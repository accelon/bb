Once the Lord was travelling along the main road between Rājagaha and Nāḷandā^f2 with a large company of some five hundred monks. 
And the wanderer Suppiya was also travelling on that road with his pupil the youth Brahmadatta. 
And Suppiya ^f3 was finding fault in all sorts of ways with the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, 
whereas his pupil Brahmadatta was speaking in various ways in their praise. 
And so these two, teacher and pupil, directly opposing each other’s arguments, followed close behind the Lord and his order of monks.
^n2 Then the Lord stopped for one night with his monks at the royal park of Ambalaṭṭhikā. 
And Suppiya too stopped there for the night with his pupil Brahmadatta. 
And Suppiya went on abusing the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, 
while his pupil Brahmadatta defended them. 
And thus disputing, they followed close behind the Buddha and his order of monks.
^n3 Now in the early morning a number of monks, having got up, gathered together and sat in the Round Pavilion, and this was the trend of their talk: 
‘It is wonderful, friends, it is marvellous how the Blessed Lord, the Arahant, the fully-enlightened Buddha knows, sees and clearly distinguishes the different inclinations of beings! 
For here is the wanderer Suppiya finding fault in all sorts of ways with the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, 
while his pupil Brahmadatta in various ways defends them. 
And, still disputing, they follow closely behind the Blessed Lord and his order of monks.’
^n4 Then the Lord, being aware of what those monks were saying, went to the Round Pavilion and sat down on the prepared seat. 
Then he said: ‘Monks, what was the subject of your conversation just now? What talk have I interrupted?’ 
And they told him.






^n5 ‘Monks, if anyone should speak in disparagement of me, of the Dhamma or of the Sangha, you should not be angry, resentful or upset on that account. 
If you were to be angry or displeased at such disparagement, that would only be a hindrance to you. 
For if others disparage me, the Dhamma or the Sangha, and you are angry or displeased, can you recognise whether what they say is right or not?’ 
‘No, Lord.’ 
‘If others disparage me, the Dhamma or the Sangha, then you must explain what is incorrect as being incorrect, saying: 
“That is incorrect, that is false, that is not our way,^f4 that is not found among us.”
^n6 ‘But, monks, if others should speak in praise of me, of the Dhamma or of the Sangha, you should not on that account be pleased, happy or elated. 
If you were to be pleased, happy or elated at such praise, that would only be a hindrance to you. 
 If others praise me, the Dhamma or the Sangha, you should acknowledge the truth of what is true, saying: 
“That is correct, that is right, that is our way, that is found among us.”
^n7 ‘It is, monks, for elementary, inferior matters of moral practice^f5 that the worldling^f6 would praise the Tathāgata.^f7 
And what are these elementary, inferior matters for which the worldling would praise him?’ 
^n8  ^z1[Short Section on Morality]^f8“‘Abandoning the taking of life, the ascetic Gotama dwells refraining from taking life, without stick or sword, scrupulous, compassionate, trembling for the welfare of all living beings.” 
Thus the worldling would praise the Tathāgata.^f9
 “Abandoning the taking of what is not given, the ascetic Gotama dwells refraining from taking what is not given, living purely, accepting what is given, awaiting what is given, without stealing. 

Abandoning unchastity, the ascetic Gotama lives far from it, aloof from the village-practice of sex.^f10

^n9 “‘Abandoning false speech, the ascetic Gotama dwells refraining from false speech, a truth-speaker, one to be relied on, trustworthy, dependable, not a deceiver of the world. 

Abandoning malicious speech, he does not repeat there what he has heard here to the detriment of these, or repeat here what he has heard there to the detriment of those. Thus he is a reconciler of those at variance and an encourager of those at one, rejoicing in peace, loving it, delighting in it, one who speaks up for peace. Abandoning harsh speech, he refrains from it. 

He speaks whatever is blameless, pleasing to the ear, agreeable, reaching the heart, urbane, pleasing and attractive to the multitude. Abandoning idle chatter, he speaks at the right time, what is correct and to the point,^f11 of Dhamma and discipline. 

He is a speaker whose words are to be treasured, seasonable, reasoned, well-defined and connected with the goal.”^f12
 Thus the worldling would praise the Tathagata.
^n10 “‘The ascetic Gotama is a refrainer from damaging seeds and crops. 

He eats once a day and not at night, refraining from eating at improper times.^f13
 He avoids watching dancing, singing, music and shows. 
He abstains from using garlands, perfumes, cosmetics, ornaments and adornments. 
He avoids using high or wide beds. 
He avoids accepting gold and silver.^f14
 He avoids accepting raw grain
 or raw flesh,
 he does not accept women and young girls,
 male or female slaves,
 sheep and goats,
 cocks and pigs,
 elephants, cattle, horses and mares,
 fields and plots;^f15
 he refrains from running errands,
 from buying and selling,
 from cheating with false weights and measures,
 from bribery and corruption, deception and insincerity,
 from wounding, killing, imprisoning, highway robbery, and taking food by force.” 
Thus the worldling would praise the Tathagata.’

 the ascetic Gotama refrains from such self-adornment.

^n17 “‘Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins remain addicted to such unedifying conversation^f23 as about

 the ascetic Gotama refrains from such conversation.

^n18 “‘Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins remain addicted to disputation such as:
 ‘You don’t understand this doctrine and discipline - I do!’ ‘How could you understand this doctrine and discipline?’ ‘Your way is all wrong — mine is right!’ ‘I am consistent - you aren’t!’ ‘You said last what you should have said first, and you said first what you should have said last!’ ‘What you took so long to think up has been refuted!’ ‘Your argument has been overthrown, you’re defeated!’ ‘Go on, save your doctrine — get out of that if you can!’ 
the ascetic Gotama refrains from such disputation.^f26

^n19 “‘Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins remain addicted to such things as running errands and messages,
 such as for kings, ministers, nobles, Brahmins, householders and young men who say: ‘Go here — go there! Take this there — bring that from there!’ 
the ascetic Gotama refrains from such errand-running.

^n20 “‘Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins remain addicted to deception, patter, hinting, belittling, and are always .on the make for further gains,

Thus the worldling would praise the Tathāgata.’^f27

 ^z1[Large Section on Morality] ^n21  ^z1[Large Section on Morality] “‘Whereas some ascetics and Brahmins, feeding on the food of the faithful, make their living by such base arts, such wrong means of livelihood as

 It is, monks, for such elementary, inferior matters of moral practice that the worldling would praise the Tathagata.

^n28 ‘There are, monks, other matters, profound, hard to see, hard to understand, peaceful, excellent, beyond mere thought, subtle, to be experienced by the wise, which the Tathāgata, having realised them by his own super-knowledge, proclaims, and about which those who would truthfully praise the Tathagata would rightly speak.
 And what are these matters?’ 
^n29  ^z1[The Sixty-Two Kinds of Wrong Views] ‘There are, monks, some ascetics and Brahmins who are speculators about the past, having fixed views about the past, and who put forward various speculative theories about the past, in eighteen different ways.
 On what basis, on what grounds do they do so?
^n30 ‘There are some ascetics and Brahmins who are Eternalists, who proclaim the eternity of the self and the world in four ways.
 On what grounds?
^n31 〔Wrong view 1〕^f34 ‘Here, monks, a certain ascetic or Brahmin has by means of effort, exertion, application, earnestness and right attention attained to such a state of mental concentration that he thereby recalls past existences -
 one birth, two births, three, four, five, ten births, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand births, several hundred, several thousand, several hundred thousand births. “There my name was so-and-so, my clan was so-and-so, my caste was so-and-so, my food was such-and-such, I experienced such-and-such pleasant and painful conditions, I lived for so long. Having passed away from there, I arose there. There my name was so-and-so ... And having passed away from there, I arose here.” Thus he remembers various past , lives, their conditions and details. 
And he says: 
“The self and the world are eternal, barren^f35 like a mountain-peak, set firmly as a post. 
These beings rush round, circulate, pass away and re-arise, but this remains eternally. 
Why so? 
I have by means of effort, exertion, attained to such a state of mental concentration that I have thereby recalled various past existences ... 


That is how I know the self and the world are eternal...” 

That is the first way in which some ascetics and Brahmins proclaim the eternity of the self and the world.
^n32 〔Wrong view 2〕 ‘And what is the second way? 
Here, monks, a certain ascetic or Brahmin has by means of effort, exertion... 
attained to such a state of mental concentration that he thereby recalls one period of contraction and expansion, ^f36 two such periods, three, four, five, ten periods of contraction and expansion... “There my name was so-and-so...” 








That is the second way in which some ascetics and Brahmins proclaim the eternity of the self and the world.
^n33 〔Wrong view 3〕 ‘And what is the third way? 
Here, monks, a certain ascetic or Brahmin has by means of effort... 
attained to such a state of mental concentration that he recalls ten, twenty, thirty, forty periods of contraction and expansion. “There my name was so-and-so...” 








That is the third way in which some ascetics and Brahmins proclaim the eternity of the self and the world.
^n34 〔Wrong view 4〕 ‘And what is the fourth way?
 Here a certain ascetic or Brahmin is a logician,^f37 a reasoner. Hammering it out by reason, following his own line of thought, he argues: 
“The self and the world are eternal, barren like a mountain-peak, set firmly as a post. 
These beings rush round, circulate, pass away and re-arise, but this remains for ever.” 
That is the fourth way in which some ascetics and Brahmins proclaim the eternity of the self and the world.
^n35 ‘These are the four ways in which these ascetics and Brahmins are Etemalists, and proclaim the eternity of the self and the world on four grounds.
 And whatever ascetics or Brahmins are Eternalists and proclaim the eternity of the self and the world, they do so on one or other of these four grounds. There is no other way.
^n36 ‘This, monks, the Tathāgata understands:
 These viewpoints thus grasped and adhered to will lead to such-and-such destinations in another world. 
This the Tathāgata knows, and more, but he is not attached to that knowledge. And being thus unattached he has experienced for himself perfect peace,
 and having truly understood the arising and passing away of feelings, their attraction and peril and the deliverance from them, the Tathāgata is liberated without remainder.

 ^z1[End of first recitation-section] ^n38  ^z1[End of first recitation-section] ‘There are, monks, some ascetics and Brahmins who are partly Etemalists and partly Non-Eternalists, who proclaim the partial eternity and the partial non-eternity of the self and the world in four ways.
 On what grounds?
^n39 ‘There comes a time, monks, sooner or later after a long period, when this world contracts.
 At a time of contraction, beings are mostly reborn in the Abhassara Brahmā^f38 world. 
And there they dwell, mind-made,^f39 feeding on delight,^f40 self-luminous, moving through the air, glorious — and they stay like that for a very long time.
^n40 〔Wrong view 5〕 ‘But the time comes, sooner or later after a long period, when this world begins to expand.
 In this expanding world an empty palace of Brahmā^f41 appears. 
And then one being, from exhaustion of his life-span or of his merits,^f42 falls from the Abhassara world and arises in the empty Brahmā-palace. 
And there he dwells, mind-made, feeding on delight, self-luminous, moving through the air, glorious — and he stays like that for a very long time.
^n41 ‘Then in this being who has been alone for so long there arises unrest, discontent and worry, and he thinks:
 “Oh, if only some other beings would come here!”
 And other beings, from exhaustion of their life-span or of their merits, fall from the Abhassara world and arise in the Brahmāpalace as companions for this being.
 And there they dwell, mind-made, ... and they stay like that for a very long time.
^n42 ‘And then, monks, that being who first arose there thinks: 
“I am Brahma, the Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, the All-Powerful, the Lord, the Maker and Creator, Ruler, Appointer and Orderer, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be. 
These beings were created by me. 
How so? 
Because I first had this thought: 
‘Oh, if only some other beings would come here!’ 
That was my wish, and then these beings came into this existence!” 
But those beings who arose subsequently think: 
“This, friends, is Brahma, Great Brahma, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, the All-Powerful, the Lord, the Maker and Creator, Ruler, Appointer and Orderer,
 Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be. 
How so? 
We have seen that he was here first, and that we arose after him.”
^n43 ‘And this being that arose first is longer-lived, more beautiful and more powerful than they are.

^n44  And it may happen that some being falls from that realm and arises in this world. 
Having arisen in this world, he goes forth from the household life into homelessness. 
Having gone forth, he by means of effort, exertion, application, earnestness and right attention attains to such a degree of mental concentration that he thereby recalls his last existence, but recalls none before that. 
And he thinks: 
“That Brahmā,...he made us, and he is permanent, stable, eternal, not subject to change, the same for ever and ever. 
But we who were created by that Brahma, we are impermanent, unstable, short-lived, fated to fall away, and we have come to this world.” 
This is the first case whereby some ascetics and Brahmins are partly Eternalists and partly Non-Eternalists.
^n45 〔Wrong view 6〕 ‘And what is the second way?
 There are, monks, certain devas called Corrupted by Pleasure.^f43 They spend an excessive amount of time addicted to merriment, play and enjoyment, so that their mindfulness is dissipated, and by the dissipation of mindfulness those beings fall from that state.

Having arisen in this world, he goes forth from the household life into homelessness. 
Having gone forth, he by means of effort, exertion, ... recalls his last existence, but recalls none before that.
‘He thinks:
 “Those reverend devas who are not corrupted by pleasure do not spend an excessive amount of time addicted to merriment, play and enjoyment. Thus their mindfulness is not dissipated, and so they do not fall from that state. 
They are permanent, stable, eternal, not subject to change, the same for ever and ever. 
But we, who are corrupted by pleasure, spent an excessive amount of time addicted to merriment, play and enjoyment. 
Thus we, by the dissipation of mindfulness, have fallen from that state, we are impermanent, unstable, short-lived, fated to fall away, and we have come to this world.” 
This is the second case.
^n47 〔Wrong view 7〕 ‘And what is the third way?
 There are, monks, certain devas called Corrupted in Mind.^f44 They spend an excessive amount of time regarding each other with envy. By this means their minds are corrupted. On account of their corrupted minds they become weary in body and mind. And they fall from that place.
^n48 ‘And it can happen that a being, having fallen from that state, arises in this world. He ...

‘He thinks:
 “Those reverend devas who are not corrupted in mind do not spend an excessive amount of time regarding each other with envy ... They do not become corrupted in mind, or weary in body and mind, and so they do not fall from that state.

 “Sir, there is such a self as you say. I don’t deny it.

Why so? 
Because, sir, sense-desires are impermanent, painful and subject to change, and from their change and transformation there arise sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and distress. 
But when this self, detached from sense-desires, detached from unwholesome states, enters and abides in the first jhāna,^f69 which is accompanied by thinking and pondering,^f70 and the delight^f71 and happiness^f72 born of detachment, that is when the self realises the highest Nibbāna here and now.”

^n97 〔Wrong view 61〕 ‘Another says to him:

But when the self, with the waning of delight, dwells in equanimity,^f74 mindful and clearly aware,^f75 experiencing in his own body that joy of which the Noble Ones say: ‘Happy dwells one who has equanimity and mindfulness’, and so enters and abides in the third jhāna,

 “Sir, there is such a self as you say. I don’t deny it.

^ck#d2(^z1[Sāmaññaphala Sutta:]^h[The Fruits of the Homeless Life ])^n150 THUS HAVE I HEARD.
 Once the Lord was staying at Rājagaha, in Jivaka Komārabhacca’s^f81 mango-grove, together with a large company of some twelve hundred and fifty monks.
 And at that time King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta^f82 of Magadha, having gone up to the roof of his palace, was sitting there surrounded by his ministers, on the fifteenth-day fast-day,^f83 the full-moon of the fourth month,^f84 called Komudi.^f85
 And King Ajatasattu, on that fast-day, gave vent to this solemn utterance: 
‘Delightful, friends, is this moonlight night! Charming is this moonlight night! Auspicious is this moonlight night! 
Can we not today visit some ascetic or Brahmin, to visit whom would bring peace to our heart?’^f86
^n151 Then one minister said to King Ajatasattu:
 ‘Sire, there is Pūraṇa Kassapa, who has many followers, a teacher of many, who is well-known, renowned, the founder of a sect, highly honoured by the multitude, of long standing, long-since gone forth, aged and venerable. 
May Your Majesty visit this Pūraṇa Kassapa. 
He may well bring peace to Your Majesty’s heart.’ 
At these words King Ajatasattu was silent.
^n152 Another minister said: 
‘Sire, there is Makkhali Gosala, who has many followers ... 

He may well bring peace to your Majesty’s heart.’ 
At these words King Ajatasattu was silent.
^n153 Another minister said: 
‘Sire, there is Ajita Kesakambali ...’ 

At these words King Ajatasattu was silent.

^n154 Another minister said: 
‘Sire, there is Pakudha Kaccayana ...’ 


At these words King Ajātasattu was silent.
^n155 Another minister said: 
‘Sire, there is Sañjaya Belatthaputta...’ 


At these words King Ajātasattu was silent.
^n156 Another minister said:
 ‘Sire, there is the Nigantha Nataputta, who has many followers, a teacher of many, who is well-known, ... aged and venerable. 
May Your Majesty visit the Nigantha Nataputta. 
He may well bring peace to Your Majesty’s heart.’ 
At these words King Ajatasattu was silent.
^n157 All this time Jivaka Komarabhacca was sitting silently near King Ajatasattu.
 The King said to him: 
‘You, friend Jivaka, why are you silent?’ 
‘Sire, there is this Blessed Lord, the Arahant, the fully-enlightened Buddha staying in my mango-grove with a large company of some twelve hundred and fifty monks. 
And concerning the Blessed Gotama this fair report has been spread about: 
“This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, the Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed,^f87 Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed.” 
May Your Majesty visit the Blessed Lord. 
He may well bring peace to Your Majesty’s heart.’ 
^n158 ‘Then, Jivaka, have the riding-elephants made ready.’
 ‘Very good, Sire’, said Jivaka, and he had five hundred she-elephants made ready, and for the King the royal tusker.
 Then he reported: ‘Sire, the riding-elephants are ready.
 Now is the time to do as Your Majesty wishes.’ 
^n159 And King Ajātasattu, having placed his wives each on one of the five hundred she-elephants, mounted the royal tusker and proceeded in royal state, accompanied by torch-bearers, from Rajagaha towards Jīvaka’s mango-grove.
And when King Ajatasattu came near the mango-grove he felt fear and terror, and his hair stood on end. 
And feeling this fear and the rising of the hairs, the King said to Jīvaka: 
‘Friend Jivaka, you are not deceiving me? 
You are not tricking me? 
You are not delivering me up to an enemy? 
How is it that from this great number of twelve hundred and fifty monks not a sneeze, a cough or a shout is to be heard?’
‘Have no fear, Your Majesty,
 I would not deceive you
 or trick you
 or deliver you up to an enemy. 
Approach, Sire, approach. There are the lights burning in the round pavilion.’
^n160 So King Ajatasattu, having ridden on his elephant as far as the ground would permit, alighted and continued on foot to the door of the round pavilion. Then he said:
 ‘Jivaka, where is the Lord?’ 
‘That is the Lord, Sire. 
That is the Lord sitting against the middle column with his order of monks in front of him.’
^n161 Then King Ajātasattu went up to the Lord and stood to one side,
 and standing there to one side the King observed how the order of monks continued in silence like a clear lake, and he exclaimed:
 ‘If only Prince Udāyabhadda were possessed of such calm as this order of monks!’
‘Do your thoughts go to the one you love, Your Majesty?’ 
‘Lord, Prince Udāyabhadda^f88 is very dear to me. 
If only he were possessed of the same calm as this order of monks!’
^n162 Then King Ajātasattu, having bowed down to the Lord and saluted the order of monks with joined hands,
 sat down to one side and said: 
‘Lord, I would ask something, if the Lord would deign to answer me.’ 

‘Ask, Your Majesty, anything you like.’
^n163 ‘Lord, just as there are these various craftsmen,
 such as elephant-drivers, horse-drivers, chariot-fighters, archers, standard-bearers, adjutants, army caterers, champions and senior officers, scouts, heroes, brave fighters, cuirassiers, slaves’ sons,
 cooks, barbers, bathmen, bakers, garland-makers, bleachers, weavers, basket-makers, potters, calculators and accountants — and whatever other skills there are: they enjoy here and now the visible fruits of their skills,
 they themselves are delighted and pleased with this, as are their parents, children and colleagues and friends, they maintain and support ascetics and Brahmins, thus assuring for themselves a heavenly, happy reward tending towards paradise. 
Can you, Lord, point to such a reward visible here and now as a fruit of the homeless life?’
^n164 ‘Your Majesty, do you admit that you have put this question to other ascetics and Brahmins?’
 ‘I admit it, Lord.’ 
‘Would Your Majesty mind saying how they replied?’ 
‘I do not mind telling the Lord, or one like him.’ 
‘Well then, Your Majesty, tell me.’
^n165 ‘Once, Lord, I went to see Pūraṇa Kassapa.^f89
 Having exchanged courtesies, I sat down to one side and said: 
“Good Kassapa, just as there are these various craftsmen, ... 
they enjoy here and now the visible fruits of their skills ... (^i[as verse 14]). 
Can you, Kassapa, point to such a reward visible here and now as a fruit of the homeless life?”

^n166 ‘At this, Lord, Pūraṇa Kassapa said:
 “Your Majesty, by the doer or instigator of a thing, by one who cuts or causes to be cut, by one who bums or causes to be burnt, by one who causes grief and weariness, by one who agitates or causes agitation, who causes life to be taken or that which is not given to be taken, commits burglary, carries off booty, commits robbery, lies in ambush, commits adultery and tells lies, no evil is done. If with a razor-sharp wheel one were to make of this earth one single mass and heap of flesh, there would be no evil as a result of that, no evil would accrue. 
If one were to go along the south bank of the Ganges killing, slaying, cutting or causing to be cut, burning or causing to be burnt, there would be no evil as a result of that, no evil would accrue. 
Or if one were to go along the north bank of the Ganges giving and causing to be given, sacrificing and causing to be sacrificed, there would be no merit as a result of that, no merit would accrue. 
In giving, self-control, abstinence and telling the truth, there is no merit, and no merit accrues.”

‘Thus, Lord, Pūraṇa Kassapa, on being asked about the present fruits of the homeless life, explained non-action to me. 
Just as if on being asked about a mango he were to describe a breadfruit-tree, or on being asked about a breadfruit-tree he were to describe a mango, so Pūraṇa Kassapa, on being asked about the present fruits of the homeless life, explained non-action to me. 
And, Lord, I thought: 
“How should one like me think despitefully of any ascetic or Brahmin dwelling in my territory?”^f90
 so I neither applauded nor rejected Pūraṇa Kassapa’s words but, though displeased, not expressing my displeasure, saying nothing, rejecting and scorning speech, I got up and left.

^n167 ‘Once I visited Makkhali Gosāla,^f91 and asked him the same question.



^n168 ‘Makkahali Gosāla said:
 “Your Majesty, there is no cause or condition^f92 for the defilement of beings, they are defiled without cause or condition.
 There is no cause or condition for the purification of beings,
 they are purified without cause or condition. 
There is no self-power or other-power, there is no power in humans, no strength or force, no vigour or exertion. 
All beings, all living things, all creatures, all that lives is without control, without power or strength, they experience the fixed course of pleasure and pain through the six kinds of rebirth. 
There are one million four hundred thousand principal sorts of birth, and six thousand others and again six hundred. There are five hundred kinds of kamma,^f93 or five kinds,^f94 and three kinds,^f95 and half-kamma, ^f96 sixty-two paths, sixty-two intermediary aeons, six classes of humankind, eight stages of human progress, four thousand nine hundred occupations, four thousand nine hundred wanderers, four thousand nine hundred abodes of nagas,^f97 two thousand sentient existences, three thousand hells, thirty-six places of dust, seven classes of rebirth as conscious beings, seven as unconscious beings, and seven as beings ‘freed from bonds’,^f98 seven grades of devas, men, goblins, seven lakes, seven great and seven small protuberances,^f99 seven great and seven small abysses, seven great and seven small dreams, eight million four hundred thousand aeons during which fools and wise run on and circle round till they make an end of suffering.
‘“Therefore there is no such thing as saying: ‘By this discipline or practice or austerity or holy life I will bring my un-ripened kamma to fruition, or I will gradually make this ripened kamma go away.’^f100
 Neither of these things is possible, because pleasure and pain have been measured out with a measure limited by the round of birth-and-death, and there is neither increase nor decrease, neither excellence nor inferiority. 
Just as a ball of string when thrown runs till it is all unravelled,
 so fools and wise run on and circle round till they make an end of suffering.”
^n169 ‘Thus, Lord, Makkhali Gosala, on being asked about the fruits of the homeless life, explained the purification of the round of birth-and-death to me... 




So I neither applauded nor rejected Makkhali Gosala’s words but...
got up and left.
^n170 ‘Once I visited Ajita Kesakambalī^f101 and asked him the same question.



^n171 ‘Ajita Kesakambali said: 
“Your Majesty, there is nothing given, bestowed, offered in sacrifice, there is no fruit or result of good or bad deeds, there is not this world or the next, there is no mother or father, there are no spontaneously arisen beings,^f102 there are in the world no ascetics or Brahmins who have attained, who have perfectly practised, who proclaim this world and the next, having realised them by their own super-knowledge. 
This human being is composed of the four great elements, and when one dies the earth part reverts to earth, the water part to water, the fire part to fire, the air part to air, and the faculties pass away into space. 
They accompany the dead man with four bearers and the bier as fifth,
 their footsteps are heard as far as the cremation-ground. 
There the bones whiten, the sacrifice ends in ashes. 
It is the idea of a fool to give this gift: 
the talk of those who preach a doctrine of survival is vain and false. 
Fools and wise, at the breaking-up of the body, are destroyed and perish, they do not exist after death.”
^n172 ‘Thus, Lord, Ajita Kesakambali, on being asked about the fruits of the homeless life, explained the doctrine of annihilation to me ... 
... 




I got up and left.
^n173 ‘Once I visited Pakudha Kaccāyana,^f103 and asked him the same question.



^n174 ‘Pakudha Kaccayana said: 
“Your Majesty, these seven things are not made or of a kind to be made, uncreated, unproductive, barren, false, stable as a column. 
They do not shake, do not change, obstruct one another, nor are they able to cause one another pleasure, pain, or both. 
What are the seven? 
The earth-body, the water-body, the fire-body, the air-body, pleasure and pain and the life-principle. 
These seven are not made...
Thus there is neither slain nor slayer, neither hearer nor proclaimer, neither knower nor causer of knowing. 
And whoever cuts off a man’s head with a sharp sword does not deprive anyone of life, he just inserts the blade in the intervening space between these seven bodies.” 


^n175 ‘Thus, Lord, Pakudha Kaccayana, on being asked about the fruits of the homeless life, answered with something quite different...





I got up and left.
^n176 ‘I visited the Nigantha Nātaputta,^f104 and asked him the same question.



^n177 ‘The Nigaṇṭha Nataputta said: 
“Your Majesty, here a Nigantha is bound by a fourfold restraint. 
What four? 
He is curbed by all curbs, enclosed by all curbs, cleared by all curbs, and claimed by all curbs.^f105
 
And as far as a Nigantha is bound by this fourfold restraint,
 thus the Nigantha is called self-perfected, self-controlled, self-established.”
^n178 ‘Thus, Lord, the Nigantha Nātaputta, on being asked about the fruits of the homeless life, explained the fourfold restraint to me ... 





I got up and left.
^n179 ‘Once I visited Sañjaya Belatthaputta,
 and asked him the same question.


^n180 ‘Sañjaya Belatthaputta said:
 “If you ask me: ‘Is there another world?’ if I thought so, I would say so. 
But I don’t think so. I don’t say it is so, and I don’t say otherwise. I don’t say it is not, and I don’t not say it is not. 
If you ask: ‘Isn’t there another world?’...
‘Both?’...
‘Neither?’...




‘Is there fruit and result of good and bad deeds?’ 
‘Isn’t there?’...
‘Both?’...
‘Neither? ’...
‘Does the Tathagata 〔5.9〕 exist after death?’ 
‘Does he not?’...
‘Both?’...
‘Neither?’... 
I don’t not say it is not.”
^n181 ‘Thus, Lord, Sañjaya Belatthaputta, on being asked about the fruits of the homeless life, replied by evasion. 
Just as if on being asked about a mango he were to describe a breadfruit-tree ... 

And I thought: 
“Of all these ascetics and Brahmins, Sañjaya Belatthaputta is the most stupid and confused.” 



So I neither applauded nor rejected his words, but go up and left.

^n182 ‘And so, Lord, I now ask the Blessed Lord: 
Just as there are these various craftsmen, ... 
who enjoy here and now the visible fruits of their skills,... 
assuring for themselves a heavenly, happy reward... 

Can you, Lord, point to such a reward, visible here and now, as a fruit of the homeless life?’ 
^n183‘I can, Your Majesty. 
 I will just ask a few questions in return and you, Sire, shall answer as you see fit.
‘What do you think, Sire?
 Suppose there were a man, a slave, a labourer, getting up before you and going to bed after you, willingly doing whatever has to be done, well-mannered, pleasant-spoken, working in your presence. 
And he might think: 
“It is strange, it is wonderful, the destiny and fruits of meritorious deeds!^f106
 This King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha is a man, and I too am a man. 
The King is addicted to and indulges in the fivefold sense-pleasures, just like a god, whereas I am a slave...
working in his presence. 
I ought to do something meritorious. 
Suppose I were to shave off my hair and beard, don yellow robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness!” 
And before long he does so. 
And he, having thus gone forth might dwell, restrained in body, speech and thought, satisfied with the minimum of food and clothing, content, in solitude. 
And then if people were to announce to you: 
“Sire, you remember that slave who worked in your presence, and who shaved off his hair and beard and went forth into homelessness? 
He is living restrained in body, speech and thought, ... 
in solitude” 
— would you then say: 
“That man must come back and be a slave and work for me as before”?’
^n184 ‘No indeed, Lord.
 For we should pay homage to him, we should rise and invite him and press him to receive from us robes, food, lodging, medicines for sickness and requisites, and make arrangements for his proper protection.’ 
^n185‘What do you think, Sire? 
 Is that one fruit of the homeless life visible here and now?’ 
‘Certainly, Lord.’ 
‘Then that, Sire, is the first such fruit of the homeless life.’
^n186 ‘But, Lord, can you show any other reward, visible here and now, as a fruit of the homeless life?’ 
‘I can, Sire. 
I will just ask a few questions in return and you, Sire, shall answer as you see fit. 
What do you think, Sire? 
Suppose there were a man, a farmer, a householder, in your service, the steward of an estate. 
He might think: 
“It is strange, it is wonderful, the destiny and fruits of meritorious deeds! 
This King Ajātasattu is a man, and I too am a man. 
The King is addicted to and indulges in the fivefold sense-pleasures, just like a god, whereas I am a farmer, ... 
the steward of an estate. 
I ought to do something meritorious. 
Suppose I were to... 
go forth from the household life into homelessness!” 
And before long he does so. 
And he, having thus gone forth might dwell ... 
in solitude. 
And if people were to tell you this... 

would you then say: 
“That man must come back and be a steward as before”?’
^n187 ‘No indeed, Lord.
 For we should pay homage to him, we should rise and invite him and press him to receive from us robes, food, lodging, medicines for sickness and requisites, and make arrangements for his proper protection.’  
^n188 ‘What do you think, Sire? 
Is that one fruit of the homeless life visible here and now?’ 
‘Certainly, Lord.’ 
‘Then that, Sire, is the second such fruit of the homeless life.’
^n189 ‘But, Lord, can you show me any other reward, visible here and now, as a fruit of the homeless life that is more excellent and perfect than these?’ 
‘I can, Sire. 
Please listen, Your Majesty, pay proper attention, and I will speak.’ 
‘Yes, Lord’, said King Ajatasattu,
^n190   and the Lord went on:
‘Your Majesty, it happens that a Tathagata arises in the world, an Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed.
 He, having realised it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world with its devas, maras^f107 and Brahmas, its princes^f108 and people. 
He preaches the Dhamma, which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life.
^n191 ‘This Dhamma is heard by a householder or a householder’s son, or one reborn in some family or other. Having heard this Dhamma, he gains faith in the Tathagata. 
Having gained this faith,
 he reflects: 
“The household life is close and dusty, the homeless life is free as air. 
It is not easy, living the household life, to live the fully-perfected holy life, purified and polished like a conch-shell. 
Suppose I were to shave off my hair and beard, don yellow robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness!” 
^n192  And after some time, he abandons his property, small or great, leaves his circle of relatives, small or great, shaves off his hair and beard, dons yellow robes and goes forth into the homeless life.
^n193 ‘And having gone forth, he dwells restrained by the restraint of the rules, persisting in right behaviour, seeing danger in the slightest faults, observing the commitments he has taken on regarding body, deed and word, devoted to the skilled and purified life, perfected in morality, with the sense-doors guarded, skilled in mindful awareness and content. 
^n194 ‘And how, Sire, is a monk perfected in morality?
 Abandoning the taking of life, he dwells refraining from taking life, without stick or sword, scrupulous, compassionate, trembling for the welfare of all living beings. 
Thus he is accomplished in morality. 
Abandoning the taking of what is not given,... 

abandoning unchastity,...
 (^i[and so on through the three sections on morality as Sutta 1], ^i[verses 1.8 — 27]). 










A monk refrains from such base arts and wrong means of livelihood. 
Thus he is perfected in morality. 

















^n195

^n211 



^n212 ‘And then, Sire, that monk who is perfected in morality sees no danger from any side owing to his being restrained by morality. 
Just as a duly-anointed Khattiya king, having conquered his enemies, by that very fact sees no danger from any side,
 so the monk, on account of his morality, sees no danger anywhere. 
He experiences in himself the blameless bliss that comes from maintaining this Ariyan morality. 
In this way, Sire, he is perfected in morality.

^n213 ‘And how, Sire, is he a guardian of the sense-doors?
 Here a monk, on seeing a visible object with the eye, does not grasp at its major signs or secondary characteristics. 
Because greed and sorrow, evil unskilled states, would overwhelm him if he dwelt leaving this eye-faculty unguarded, so he practises guarding it, he protects the eye-faculty, develops restraint of the eye-faculty. 
On hearing a sound with the ear, ... 
on smelling an odour with the nose, ... 
on tasting a flavour with the tongue,...
on feeling an object with the body,...
on thinking a thought with the mind, he does not grasp at its major signs or secondary characteristics, ... 
he develops restraint of the mind-faculty. 
He experiences within himself the blameless bliss that comes from maintaining this Ariyan guarding of the faculties. 
In this way, Sire, a monk is a guardian of the sense-doors.
^n214 ‘And how, Sire, is a monk accomplished in mindfulness and clear awareness? 
Here a monk acts with clear awareness in going forth and back, in looking ahead or behind him, in bending and stretching, in wearing his outer and inner robe and carrying his bowl, in eating, drinking, chewing and swallowing, in evacuating and urinating, in walking, standing, sitting, lying down, in waking, in speaking and in keeping silent he acts with clear awareness. 
In this way, a monk is accomplished in mindfulness and clear awareness.
^n215 ‘And how is a monk contented? 
Here, a monk is satisfied with a robe to protect his body, with alms to satisfy his stomach, and having accepted sufficient, he goes on his way. 
Just as a bird with wings flies hither and thither, burdened by nothing but its wings, so he is satisfied... 

In this way, Sire, a monk is contented.
^n216 ‘Then he, equipped with this Ariyan morality, with this Ariyan restraint of the senses, with this Ariyan contentment,
 finds a solitary lodging, at the root of a forest tree, in a mountain cave or gorge, a charnel-ground, a jungle-thicket, or in the open air on a heap of straw. 
Then, having eaten after his return from the alms-round, he sits down cross-legged, holding his body erect, and concentrates on keeping mindfulness established before him.^f109
^n217 ‘Abandoning worldly desires, he dwells with a mind freed from worldly desires, and his mind is purified of them.
 Abandoning ill-will and hatred ... and by compassionate love for the welfare of all living beings, his mind is purified of ill-will and hatred.
 Abandoning sloth-and-torpor, ... perceiving light,^f110 mindful and clearly aware, his mind is purified of sloth-and-torpor. 
Abandoning worry-and-flurry... and with an inwardly calmed mind his heart is purified of worry-and-flurry. 
Abandoning doubt, he dwells with doubt left behind, without uncertainty as to what things are wholesome, his mind is purified of doubt.
^n218 ‘Just as a man who had taken a loan to develop his business,
 and whose business had prospered,
 might pay off his old debts, and with what was left over could support a wife,
 might think: 
“Before this I developed my business by borrowing, but now it has prospered... ”, 


and he would rejoice and be glad about that.
^n219 ‘Just as a man who was ill, suffering, terribly sick, with no appetite and weak in body,
 might after a time recover, and regain his appetite and bodily strength, 
and he might think: 
“Before this I was ill... ”,



 and he would rejoice and be glad about that.
^n220 ‘Just as a man might be bound in prison,
 and after a time he might be freed from his bonds without any loss, with no deduction from his possessions. 
He might think: 
“Before this I was in prison...”,

 and he would rejoice and be glad about that.
^n221 ‘Just as a man might be a slave, not his own master, dependent on another, unable to go where he liked,
 and after some time he might be freed from slavery, able to go where he liked,
 might think: 
“Before this I was a slave...”

And he would rejoice and be glad about that.
^n222 ‘Just as a man, laden with goods and wealth, might go on a long journey through the desert where food was scarce and danger abounded,
 and after a time he would get through the desert and arrive safe and sound at the edge of a village,
 might think: 
“Before this I was in danger, now I am safe at the edge of a village”,

 and he would rejoice and be glad about that.
^n223 ‘As long, Sire, as a monk does not perceive the disappearance of the five hindrances in himself,^f111 he feels as if in debt, in sickness, in bonds, in slavery, on a desert journey. 
^n224 But when he perceives the disappearance of the five hindrances in himself, it is as if he were freed from debt, from sickness, from bonds, from slavery, from the perils of the desert.

^n225  ‘And when he knows that these five hindrances have left him, gladness arises in him, from gladness comes delight, from the delight in his mind his body is tranquillised, with a tranquil body he feels joy, and with joy his mind is concentrated.
^n226 Being thus detached from sense-desires, detached from unwholesome states, he enters and remains in the first jhāna, which is with thinking and pondering, born of detachment, filled with delight and joy.
 And with this delight and joy born of detachment, he so suffuses, drenches, fills and irradiates his body that there is no spot in his entire body that is untouched by this delight and joy born of detachment. 
^n227 ‘Just as a skilled bathman or his assistant, kneading the soap-powder which he has sprinkled with water, forms from it, in a metal dish, a soft lump, so that the ball of soap-powder becomes one oleaginous mass, bound with oil so that nothing escapes —
 so this monk suffuses, drenches, fills and irradiates his body so that no spot remains untouched. 
This, Sire, is a fruit of the homeless life, visible here and now, that is more excellent and perfect than the former ones.^f112
^n228 ‘Again, a monk, with the subsiding of thinking and pondering, by gaining inner tranquillity and oneness of mind, enters and remains in the second jhāna, which is without thinking and pondering, born of concentration, filled with delight and joy.
 And with this delight and joy born of concentration he so suffuses his body that no spot remains untouched.
^n229 ‘Just as a lake fed by a spring, with no inflow from east, west, north or south, where the rain-god sends moderate showers from time to time,
 the water welling up from below, mingling with cool water, would suffuse, fill and irradiate that cool water, so that no part of the pool was untouched by it —
 so, with this delight and joy born of concentration he so suffuses his body that no spot remains untouched. 
This, Sire, is a fruit more excellent and perfect than the former ones.
^n230 ‘Again, a monk with the fading away of delight remains imperturbable, mindful and clearly aware, and experiences in himself that joy of which the Noble Ones say: “Happy is he who dwells with equanimity and mindfulness”, and he enters and remains in the third jhāna.
 And with this joy devoid of delight he so suffuses his body that no spot remains untouched.
^n231 ‘Just as if, in a pond of blue, red or white lotuses^f113 in which the flowers, born in the water, grown in the water, not growing out of the water, are fed from the water’s depths, those blue, red or white lotuses would be suffused ... with the cool water —
 so with this joy devoid of delight the monk so suffuses his body that no spot remains untouched. 
This is a fruit of the homeless life, more excellent and perfect than the former ones.
^n232 ‘Again, a monk, having given up pleasure and pain, and with the disappearance of former gladness and sadness, enters and remains in the fourth jhāna which is beyond pleasure and pain, and purified by equanimity and mindfulness.
 And he sits suffusing his body with that mental purity and clarification so that no part of his body is untouched by it. 
^n233 ‘Just as if a man were to sit wrapped from head to foot in a white garment, so that no part of him was untouched by that garment —
 so his body is suffused...
This is a fruit of the homeless life, more excellent and perfect than the former ones.
^n234 ‘And so, with mind concentrated, purified and cleansed, unblemished, free from impurities,^f114 malleable, workable, established, and having gained imperturbability, he directs and inclines his mind towards knowing and seeing. 
And he knows: 
“This my body is material, made up from the four great elements, born of mother and father, fed on rice and gruel, impermanent, liable to be injured and abraded, broken and destroyed,
 and this is my consciousness which is bound to it and dependent on it.”^f115
^n235 ‘It is just as if there were a gem, a beryl,^f116 pure, excellent, well cut into eight facets, clear, bright, unflawed, perfect in every respect,
 strung on a blue, yellow, red, white or orange cord. 
A man with good eyesight, taking it in his hand and inspecting it,
 would describe it as such. 

In the same way, Sire, a monk with mind concentrated, purified and cleansed, ... directs his mind towards knowing and seeing. 
And he knows: 
“This my body is material, made up of the four great elements, ...
 and this is my consciousness which is bound to it and dependent on it.” 
This is a fruit of the homeless life, more excellent and perfect than the former ones.
^n236 ‘And he, with mind concentrated, ... having gained imperturbability, applies and directs his mind to the production of a mind-made body.
 And out of this body he produces another body, having a form,^f117 mind-made, complete in all its limbs and faculties.
^n237 ‘It is just as if a man were to draw out a reed from its sheath.
 He might think:
 “This is the reed, this is the sheath, reed and sheath are different. Now the reed has been pulled from the sheath.”
 Or as if a man were to draw a sword from the scabbard.
 He might think: 
“This is the sword, this is the scabbard, sword and scabbard are different. Now the sword has been drawn from the scabbard.” 
Or as if a man were to draw a snake from its 〔old〕 skin. 
He might think: 
“This is the snake, this is the skin, snake and skin are different. Now the snake has been drawn from its skin.” 
In the same way a monk with mind concentrated ... directs his mind to the production of a mind-made body. 
He draws that body out of this body, having form, mind-made, complete with all its limbs and faculties. 
This is a fruit of the homeless life more excellent and perfect than the former ones.
^n238 ‘And he, with mind concentrated,... applies and directs his mind to the various supernormal powers.^f118
 He then enjoys different powers: being one, he becomes many — being many, he becomes one; he appears and disappears; he passes through fences, walls and mountains unhindered as if through air; he sinks into the ground and emerges from it as if it were water; he walks on the water without breaking the surface as if on land; he flies cross-legged through the sky like a bird with wings; he even touches and strokes with his hand the sun and moon, mighty and powerful as they are;^f119 and he travels in the body as far as the Brahmā world.
^n239 ‘Just as a skilled potter or his assistant can make from well-prepared clay whatever kind of bowl he likes,
 or just as a skilled ivory-carver or his assistant can produce from well-prepared ivory any object he likes,
 or just as a skilled goldsmith or his assistant can make any gold article he likes — so the monk with mind concentrated ... 

enjoys various supernormal powers ... 
This is a fruit of the homeless life ...
^n240 ‘And he, with mind concentrated,... applies and directs his mind to the divine ear.^f120
 With the divine ear, purified and surpassing that of human beings, he hears sounds both divine and human, whether far or near.
^n241 ‘Just as a man going on a long journey might hear the sound of a big drum, a small drum, a conch, cymbals or a kettle-drum, and he might think: “That is a big drum, ... a kettle-drum”,
 so the monk with mind concentrated ... 
hears sounds, divine or human, far or near. 
This is a fruit of the homeless life, more excellent and perfect than the former ones.
^n242 ‘And he, with mind concentrated,...applies and directs his mind to the knowledge of others’ minds.
 He knows and distinguishes with his mind the minds of other beings or other persons.
 He knows the mind with passion to be with passion;
 he knows the mind without passion to be without passion.^f121
 He knows the mind with hate to be with hate;
 he knows the mind without hate to be without hate.
 He knows the deluded mind to be deluded;
 he knows the undeluded mind to be undeluded.
 He knows the narrow mind to be narrow;
 he knows the broad mind to be broad.
 He knows the expanded mind to be expanded;
 he knows the unexpanded mind to be unexpanded.
 He knows the surpassed mind to be surpassed;
 he knows the unsurpassed mind to be unsurpassed.
 He knows the concentrated mind to be concentrated;
 he knows the unconcentrated mind to be unconcentrated.
 He knows the liberated mind to be liberated;
 he knows the unliberated mind to be unliberated.
^n243 ‘Just as a woman, or a man or young boy, fond of his appearance, might examine his face in a brightly polished mirror or in water, and by examination would know whether there was a spot there or not,
 so the monk, with mind concentrated, ... directs his mind to the knowledge of others’ minds... 
(^i[as verse 91]). 
















This is a fruit of the homeless life...
^n244 ‘And he, with mind concentrated,... applies and directs his mind to the knowledge of previous existences. He remembers many previous existences:
 one birth, two, three, four, five births, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty births, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand births, several periods of contraction, of expansion, of both contraction and expansion. “There my name was so-and-so, my clan was so-and-so, my caste was so-and-so, my food was such-and-such, I experienced such-and-such pleasant and painful conditions, I lived for so long. Having passed away from there, I arose there. There my name was so-and-so ... And having passed away from there, I arose here.” Thus he remembers various past births, their conditions and details.
^n245 ‘It is just as if a man were to go from his village to another, from that to yet another, and thence return to his home village. He might think: “I came from my own village to that other one where I stood, sat, spoke or remained silent like this, and from that one I went to another, where I stood, sat, spoke or remained silent like this, and from there I have just returned to my own village.”^f122
 Just so the monk with mind concentrated ... 
remembers past births ... 
This is a fruit of the homeless life...
^n246 ‘And he, with mind concentrated, ... applies and directs his mind to the knowledge of the passing-away and arising of beings.
 With the divine eye,^f123 purified and surpassing that of humans, he sees beings passing away and arising: base and noble, well-favoured and ill-favoured, to happy and unhappy destinations as kamma directs them, and he knows: “These beings, on account of misconduct of body, speech or thought, or disparaging the Noble Ones, have wrong view and will suffer the kammic fate of wrong view. At the breaking-up of the body after death they are reborn in a lower world, a bad destination, a state of suffering, hell. But these beings, on account of good conduct of body, speech or thought, of praising the Noble Ones, have right view and will reap the kammic reward of right view. At the breaking-up of the body after death they are reborn in a good destination, a heavenly world.” Thus with the divine eye... he sees beings passing away and rearising...
^n247 ‘It is just as if there were a lofty building at a crossroads, and a man with good eyesight standing there might see people entering or leaving a house, walking in the street, or sitting in the middle of the crossroads. And he might think: “These are entering a house...”
 Just so, with the divine eye, ...
he sees beings passing away and rearising... 
This is a fruit of the homeless life...
^n248 ‘And he with mind concentrated, purified and cleansed, unblemished, free from impurities, malleable, workable, established and having gained imperturbability, applies and directs his mind to the knowledge of the destruction of the corruptions.^f124
 He knows as it really is: “This is suffering”, he knows as it really is: “This is the origin of suffering”, he knows as it really is: “This is the cessation of suffering”, he knows as it really is: “This is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.”
 And he knows as it really is: “These are the corruptions”, “This is the origin of the corruptions”, “This is the cessation of the corruptions”, “This is the path leading to the cessation of the corruptions.” 
And through his knowing and seeing his mind is delivered from the corruption of sense-desire, from the corruption of becoming, from the corruption of ignorance, and the knowledge arises in him: 
“This is deliverance!”,
 and he knows: “Birth is finished, the holy life has been led, done is what had to be done, there is nothing further here.”^f125
^n249 ‘Just as if, Sire, in the midst of the mountains there were a pond, clear as a polished mirror, where a man with good eyesight standing on the bank could see oyster-shells, gravel-banks, and shoals of fish, on the move or stationary. And he might think: “This pond is clear,... there are oyster-shells ... ”,
 just so, with mind concentrated,
...he knows: “Birth is finished, the holy life has been led, done is what had to be done, there is nothing further here.” 




This, Sire, is a fruit of the homeless life, visible here and now, which is more excellent and perfect than the previous fruits. 
And, Sire, there is no fruit of the homeless life, visible here and now, that is more excellent and perfect than this.’^f126
^n250 At this King Ajātasattu exclaimed:
 ‘Excellent, Lord, excellent!
 It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there. Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways.
 And I, Lord, go for refuge to the Blessed Lord, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha. 
May the Blessed Lord accept me from this day forth as a lay-follower as long as life shall last! 
Transgression^f127 overcame me, Lord, foolish, erring and wicked as I was, in that I for the sake of the throne deprived my father, that good man and just king, of his life. 
May the Blessed Lord accept my confession of my evil deed that I may restrain myself in future!’^f128
^n251 ‘Indeed, Sire, transgression overcame you when you deprived your father, that good man and just king, of his life.
 But since you have acknowledged the transgression and confessed it as is right, we will accept it. 
For he who acknowledges his transgression as such and confesses it for betterment in future, will grow in the Ariyan discipline.’
^n252 At this, King Ajātasattu said:
 ‘Lord, permit me to depart now. I am busy and have much to do.’
 ‘Do now, Your Majesty, as you think fit.’
Then King Ajātasattu, rejoicing and delighting at these words, rose from his seat, saluted the Lord, and departed with his right side towards him.
^n253 As soon as the King had gone, the Lord said: 
‘The King is done for,
 his fate is sealed, monks!^f129
 But if the King had not deprived his father, that good man and just king, of his life, then as he sat here the pure and spotless Dhamma-eye ^f130 would have arisen in him.’
 Thus the Lord spoke,
 and the monks, delighted, rejoiced at his words.

^ck#d3(^z1[Ambaṭṭha Sutta: About Ambaṭṭha] ^h[Pride Humbled] )^n254 THUS HAVE I HEARD.
 Once the Lord was touring Kosala with a large number of monks, some five hundred, and he came to a Kosalan Brahmin village called Icchanankala.
 And he stayed in the dense jungle of Icchanankala. 
^n255 At that time the Brahmin Pokkharasati was living at Ukkhattha, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water and corn, which had been given to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala as a royal gift and with royal powers.^f131
And Pokkharasati heard say:
 ‘The ascetic Gotama, son of the Sakyans, who has gone forth from the Sakya clan,...is staying in the dense jungle of Icchanankala. 
And concerning that Blessed Lord a good report has been spread about: 
“This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, perfected in knowledge and conduct, a Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, unequalled Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, a Buddha, a Blessed Lord.” 
He proclaims this world with its gods, maras, Brahmas, the world of ascetics and Brahmins with its princes and people, having come to know it by his own knowledge. 
He teaches a Dhamma that is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, and lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and he displays the fully-perfected, thoroughly purified holy life. 
And indeed it is good to see such Arahants.’
^n256 Now at that time Pokkharasāti had a pupil, the youth Ambattha, who was a student of the Vedas, who knew the mantras, perfected in the Three Vedas, a skilled expounder of the rules and rituals, the lore of sounds and meanings and, fifthly, oral tradition, complete in philosophy^f132 and in the marks^f133 of a Great Man, admitted and accepted by his master in the Three Vedas with the words: 
‘What I know, you know;
 what you know, I know.’
^n257 And Pokkharasati said to Ambattha: 
‘Ambattha, my son, the ascetic Gotama ... is staying in the dense jungle of Icchānankala. 
And concerning that Blessed Lord a good report has been spread about ... 




Now you go to see the ascetic Gotama and find out whether this report is correct or not, and whether the Reverend Gotama is as they say or not. 
In that way we shall put the Reverend Gotama to the test.’
^n258 ‘Sir, how shall I find out whether the report is true, or whether the Reverend Gotama is as they say or not?’ 
‘According to the tradition of our mantras, Ambattha, the great man who is possessed of the thirty-two marks of a Great Man has only two courses open to him. 
If he lives the household life he will become a ruler, a wheel-turning righteous monarch of the law,^f134 conqueror of the four quarters, who has established the security of his realm and is possessed of the seven treasures.^f135
 These are: 
the Wheel-Treasure, the Elephant-Treasure, the Horse-Treasure, the Jewel-Treasure, the Woman-Treasure, the Householder-Treasure, and, as seventh, the Counsellor-Treasure. 
He has more than a thousand sons who are heroes, of heroic stature, conquerors of the hostile army. 
He dwells having conquered this sea-girt land without stick or sword, by the law. 
But if he goes forth from the household life into homelessness, then he will become an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, one who draws back the veil from the world.^f136
 And, Ambattha, I am the passer-on of the mantras,
 and you are the receiver.’
^n259 ‘Very good, sir’, said Ambattha at Pokkharasāti’s words, and he got up, passed by Pokkharasati with his right side, got into his chariot drawn by a mare and, accompanied by a number of young men, headed for the dense jungle of Icchānankala.
 He drove as far as the carriage would go, then alighted and continued on foot.
At that time a number of monks were walking up and down in the open air.
 Ambattha approached them and said: 
‘Where is the Reverend Gotama to be found just now? 
We have come to see the Reverend Gotama.’
^n260 The monks thought:
 ‘This is Ambattha, a youth of good family and a pupil of the distinguished Brahmin Pokkharasāti.
 The Lord would not mind having a conversation with such a young man.’
 And they said to Ambattha: 
‘That is his dwelling, with the door closed. Go quietly up to it, go on to the verandah without haste, cough, and knock on the bolt. The Lord will open the door to you.’
^n261 Ambattha went up to the dwelling and on to the verandah, coughed, and knocked. The Lord opened the door, and Ambaṭṭha went in. 
The young men entered, exchanged courtesies with the Lord, and sat down to one side. 
But Ambattha walked up and down while the Lord sat there, uttered some vague words of politeness, and then stood so speaking before the seated Lord.
^n262 And the Lord said to Ambattha: 
 ‘Well now, Ambattha, would you behave like this if you were talking to venerable and learned Brahmins, teachers of teachers, as you do with me, walking and standing while I am sitting, and uttering vague words of politeness?’
^n263 ‘No, Reverend Gotama.
 A Brahmin should walk with a walking Brahmin, stand with a standing Brahmin, sit with a sitting Brahmin, and lie down with a Brahmin who is lying down. 
But as for those shaven little ascetics, menials, black scourings from Brahmā’s foot, with them it is fitting to speak just as I do with the Reverend Gotama.’
‘But, Ambattha, you came here seeking something. Whatever it was you came for, you should listen attentively to hear about it.
 Ambattha, you have not perfected your training. Your conceit of being trained is due to nothing but inexperience.’
^n264 But Ambattha was angry and displeased at being called untrained, and he turned on the Lord with curses and insults. Thinking: 
‘The ascetic Gotama bears me ill-will’, he said: 
‘Reverend Gotama, the Sakyans are fierce,
 rough-spoken,
 touchy
 and violent. 
Being of menial origin, being menials, they do not honour, respect, esteem, revere or pay homage to Brahmins. 
With regard to this it is not proper... that they do not pay homage to Brahmins.’ 
This was the first time Ambattha accused the Sakyans of being menials.
^n265 ‘But, Ambattha, what have the Sakyans done to you?’ 
‘Reverend Gotama, once I went to Kapilavatthu on some business for my teacher, the Brahmin Pokkharasāti,
 and I came to the Sakyans’ meeting-hall. 
And at that time a lot of Sakyans were sitting on high seats in their meeting-hall, poking each other with their fingers, laughing and playing about together, and it seemed to me that they were just making fun of me, and no one offered me a seat. 
With regard to this, it is not proper that they do not pay homage to the Brahmins.’ 
This was the second time Ambattha accused the Sakyans of being menials.
^n266 ‘But Ambattha, even the quail, that little bird, can talk as she likes on her own nest. 
Kapilavatthu is the Sakyans’ home, Ambattha. They do not deserve censure for such a trifle.’
‘Reverend Gotama, there are four castes:^f137
 the Khattiyas, the Brahmins, the merchants and the artisans. 
And of these four castes three —
 the Khattiyas, the merchants and the artisans —
 are entirely subservient to the Brahmins. 
With regard to this, it is not proper that they should not pay homage to the Brahmins.’ 
This was the third time Ambattha accused the Sakyans of being menials.
^n267 Then the Lord thought: ‘This young man goes too far in abusing the Sakyans.
 Suppose I were to ask after his clan-name? 
’ So he said: 
‘Ambattha, what is your clan?’ 
‘I am a Kaṇhāyan, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Ambattha, in former days, according to those who remember the ancestral lineage, the Sakyans were the masters, and you are descended from a slave-girl of the Sakyans. 
For the Sakyans regard King Okkāka as their ancestor. 
At one time King Okkāka, to whom his queen was dear and beloved, wishing to transfer the kingdom to her son, banished his elder brothers from the kingdom —
 Okkamukha, Karandu, Hatthiniya and Sinipura. 
And these, being banished, made their home on the flank of the Himālayas beside a lotus-pond where there was a big grove of teak-trees.^f138
 And for fear of contaminating the stock they cohabited with their own sisters. 
Then King Okkāka asked his ministers and counsellors: 
“Where are the princes living now?” and they told him. 


At this King Okkāha exclaimed:
 “They are strong as teak (^i[sāka]), these princes, they are real Sakyans!”^f139 And that is how the Sakyans got their well-known name.
 And the King was the ancestor of the Sakyans.
‘Now King Okkāka had a slave-girl called Disā,
 who gave birth to a black child.
 The black thing, when it was born, exclaimed:
 “Wash me, mother! Bath me, mother! Deliver me from this dirt, and I will bring you profit!” 
Because, Ambattha, just as people today use the term hobgoblin ^i[(pisāca)] as a term of abuse,
 so in those days they said black (^i[kaṇha]). 
And they said: 
“As soon as he was born, he spoke. He is born a Kanha, a hobgoblin!” 
That is how in former days...
the Sakyans were the masters, and you are descended from a slave-girl of the Sakyans.’
^n268 On hearing this, the young men said:
 ‘Reverend Gotama, do not humiliate Ambattha too much with talk of his being descended from a slave-girl: 
Ambattha is well-born, of a good family, he is very learned, he is well-spoken, a scholar, well able to hold his own in this discussion with the Reverend Gotama!’
^n269 Then the Lord said to the young men: 
‘If you consider that
 Ambattha is ill-born, not of a good family, unlearned, ill-spoken, no scholar, unable to hold his own in this discussion with the ascetic Gotama, then let Ambattha be silent, and you conduct this discussion with me. 
But if you think he is... 
able to hold his own, then you be quiet, and let him discuss with me.’

‘Ambattha is well-born, Reverend Gotama... We will be silent, he shall continue.’ 
^n270 Then the Lord said to Ambattha: 
‘Ambattha, I have a fundamental question for you, which you will not like to answer. 
If you don’t answer, or evade the issue, if you keep silent or go away, your head will split into seven pieces. 
What do you think, Ambattha? 
Have you heard from old and venerable Brahmins, teachers of teachers, where the Kaṇhāyans came from, or who was their ancestor?’ 
At this, Ambattha remained silent. 
The Lord asked him a second time. 

Again Ambattha remained silent,
 and the Lord said: 
‘Answer me now, Ambattha, this is not a time for silence. 
Whoever, Ambattha, does not answer a fundamental question put to him by a Tathāgata by the third asking has his head split into seven pieces.’^f140
^n271 And at that moment Vajirapāni the yakkha,^f141 holding a huge iron club, flaming, ablaze and glowing, up in the sky just above Ambattha, was thinking: 
‘If this young man Ambattha does not answer a proper question put to him by the Blessed Lord by the third time of asking, I’ll split his head into seven pieces!’ 
The Lord saw Vajirapāni, and so did Ambattha. 
^n272 And at the sight, Ambattha was terrified and unnerved, his hairs stood on end, and he sought protection, shelter and safety from the Lord. Crouching down close to the Lord, he said: 
‘What did the Reverend Gotama say? 
May the Reverend Gotama repeat what he said!’ 
‘What do you think, Ambattha? 
Have you heard who was the ancestor of the Kaṇhāyans?’ 
‘Yes, I have heard it just as the Reverend Gotama said,
 that is where the Kaṇhāyans came from,
 he was their ancestor.’
^n273 Hearing this, the young men made a loud noise and clamour:
 ‘So Ambattha is ill-born, not of a good family, born of a slave-girl of the Sakyans, and the Sakyans are Ambattha’s masters! 
We disparaged the ascetic Gotama, thinking he was not speaking the truth!’
^n274 Then the Lord thought:
 ‘It is too much, the way these young men humiliate Ambattha for being the son of a slave-girl. I must get him out of this.
’ So he said to the young men:
 ‘Don’t disparage Ambattha too much for being the son of a slave-girl!
 That Kanha was a mighty sage.^f142
 He went to the south country,^f143 learnt the mantras of the Brahmins there, and then went to King Okkāka and asked for his daughter Maddarūpī.
 And King Okkāka, furiously angry, exclaimed:
 “So this fellow, the son of a slave-girl, wants my daughter!”, and put an arrow to his bow. 
But he was unable either to shoot the arrow or to withdraw it.^f144
 Then the ministers and counsellors came to the sage Kanha and said: 
“Spare the king, Reverend Sir,
 spare the king!”
‘“The king will be safe, but if he looses the arrow downwards, the earth will quake as far as his kingdom extends.”
“‘Reverend Sir, spare the king, spare the land!”
‘“The king and the land will be safe, but if he looses the arrow upwards, as far as his realm extends the god will not let it rain for seven years.”^f145
‘“Reverend Sir, spare the king and the land, and may the god let it rains!”
‘“The king and the land will be safe, and the god will let it rain, but if the king points the arrow at the crown prince, the prince will be completely safe.”
‘Then the ministers exclaimed:
 “Let King Okkāka point the arrow at the crown prince, the prince will be perfectly safe!”
 The king did so, and the prince was unharmed. 
Then King Okkāka, terrified and fearful of divine punishment,^f146 gave away his daughter Maddarūpī. 
So, young men, do not disparage Ambattha too much for being the son of a slave-girl. That Kanha was a mighty sage.’
^n275 Then the Lord said:
 ‘Ambattha, what do you think?
 Suppose a Khattiya youth were to wed a Brahmin maiden, and there was a son of the union.
 Would that son of a Khattiya youth and a Brahmin maiden receive a seat and water from the Brahmins?’
 ‘He would, Reverend Gotama.’
 ‘Would they allow him to eat at funeral-rites, at rice-offerings, at sacrifices or as a guest?’ 
‘They would, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would they teach him mantras or not?’ 
‘They would, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would they keep their women covered or uncovered?’ 
‘Uncovered, Reverend Gotama.’
‘But would the Khattiyas sprinkle him with the Khattiya consecration?’ 
‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Why not?’ 
‘Because, Reverend Gotama, he is not well-born on his mother’s side.’
‘What do you think, Ambattha? 
Suppose a Brahmin youth were to wed a Khattiya maiden, and there was a son of the union. 
Would that son of a Khattiya youth and a Brahmin maiden receive a seat and water from the Brahmins?’ 
‘He would, Reverend Gotama.’ ...
(^i[as verse 24]) But would the Khattiyas sprinkle him with the Khattiya consecration?’ 
‘No, Reverend Gotama.’






‘Why not?’ 
‘Because, Reverend Gotama, he is not well-born on his father’s side.’
^n276 ‘So, Ambattha, the Khattiyas, through a man taking a woman or a woman taking a man, are senior to the Brahmins.
 What do you think, Ambattha?
 Take the case of a Brahmin who, for some reason, has had his head shaved by the Brahmins, has been punished with a bag of ashes and banished from the country or the city.
 Would he receive a seat and water from the Brahmins?’
 ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’ 
‘Would they allow him to eat... as a guest?’ 
‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would they teach him mantras, or not?’ 
‘They would not, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Would they keep their women covered or uncovered?’ 
‘Covered, Reverend Gotama.’
‘What do you think, Ambattha?
 Take the case of a Khattiya who ... had his head shaved by the Khattiyas, ... and has been banished from the country or the city. 
Would he receive a seat and water from the Brahmins?’ 
‘He would, Reverend Gotama.’ ... 




(^i[as verse 24]) ‘Would they keep their women covered or uncovered?’ 
‘Uncovered, Reverend Gotama.’
^n277‘But that Khattiya has so far reached the extreme of humiliation that he has... been banished from the country or the city. 
 So even if a Khattiya has suffered extreme humiliation, he is superior and the Brahmins inferior.
‘Ambattha, this verse was pronounced by Brahmā Sanankumāra:
“The Khattiya’s best among those
 who value clan;
 He with knowledge and
 conduct is best of gods and men.” 
‘This verse was rightly sung, not wrongly, rightly spoken, not wrongly, connected with profit, not unconnected. 
And, Ambattha, I too say this:
“The Khattiya’s best among those
 who value clan:
He with knowledge and conduct
 is best of gods and men.’”
^i[End of first recitation-section] 
^n278 ‘But, Reverend Gotama, what is this conduct, what is this knowledge?’
‘Ambattha, it is not from the standpoint of the attainment of unexcelled knowledge-and-conduct that reputation based on birth and clan is declared, nor on the conceit which says: 
“You are worthy of me, you are not worthy of me!” 
For wherever there is a giving, a taking, or a giving and taking in marriage, there is always this talk and this conceit... 

But those who are enslaved by such things are far from the attainment of the unexcelled knowledge-and-conduct,
 which is attained by abandoning all such things!’
^n279 ‘But, Reverend Gotama, what is this conduct, what is this knowledge?’
‘Ambattha, a Tathagata arises in this world an Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed. 
He, having realised it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world with its devas, maras and Brahmas, its princes and people. 
He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life.^f147
^i[A disciple goes forth and practises the moralities] (^i[Sutta 2, verse 41 — 62]);
 ^i[he guards the sensedoors, etc.]
 (^i[Sutta 2, verse 64 — 75]);
 ^i[attains the four jhānas] (^i[Sutta 2], ^i[verse 75 — 82]). 

Thus he develops conduct. 







^i[He attains various insights] (^i[Sutta 2], ^i[verse 83 — 95]),
 ^i[and the cessation of the corruptions] (^i[Sutta]2^i[, verse 97] )... 



And beyond this there is no further development of knowledge and conduct that is higher or more perfect.
^n280 ‘But, Ambattha, in the pursuit of this unexcelled attainment of knowledge and conduct there are four paths of failure.^f148
 What are they? 
In the first place, an ascetic or Brahmin who has not managed to gain^f149 this unexcelled attainment, takes his carrying-pole^f150 and plunges into the depths of the forest thinking: 
“I will live on windfalls.” 
But in this way he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained. 
This is the first path of failure. 
Again, an ascetic or Brahmin ... , being unable to live on windfalls, takes a spade and basket, thinking: 
“I will live on tubers and roots.”^f151... 

This is the second path of failure. 
Again, an ascetic or Brahmin, being unable to live on tubers and roots, makes a fire-hearth at the edge of a village or small town and sits tending the fame^f152 ... 

This is the third path of failure. 
Again, an ascetic or Brahmin, being unable to tend the flame, erects a house with four doors at the crossroads thinking: 
“Whatever ascetic or Brahmin arrives from the four quarters, I will honour to the best of my strength and ability.” 
But in this way he only becomes an attendant on one who has attained to unexcelled knowledge and conduct. 
This is the fourth path of failure.

^n281 ‘What do you think, Ambattha? 
Do you and your teacher live in accordance with this unexcelled knowledge and conduct?’ 
‘No indeed, Reverend Gotama! 
Who are my teacher and I in comparison? 
We are far from it!’
‘Well then, Ambattha,
 could you and your teacher, being unable to gain this..., go with your carrying-poles into the depths of the forest,
 intending to live on windfalls?’ 
‘No indeed, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Well then, Ambattha,
 could you and your teacher, being unable to gain this ... ,
 live on tubers and roots,


... sit tending the flame,


 ... erect a house ... ?’
 
‘No indeed, Reverend Gotama.’
^n282 ‘And so, Ambattha, not only are you and your teacher incapable of attaining this unexcelled knowledge and conduct,
 but even the four paths of failure are beyond you.
 And yet you and your teacher the Brahmin Pokkharasāti utter these words: 
“These shaven little ascetics, menials, black scrapings from Brahmā’s foot, what converse can they have with Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas?” — even though you can’t even manage the duties of one who has failed. 
See, Ambattha, how your teacher has let you down!
^n283 ‘Ambattha, the Brahmin Pokkharasāti lives by the grace and favour of King Pasenadi of Kosala.
 And yet the King does not allow him to have audience face to face. 
When he confers with the King it is through a curtain. 
Why should the King not grant audience face to face to one on whom he has bestowed a proper and blameless source of revenue? 
See how your teacher has let you down!
^n284 ‘What do you think, Ambattha? 
Suppose King Pasenadi was sitting on the neck of an elephant or on horseback, or was standing on the chariot-mat, conferring with his ministers and princes about something. 
And suppose he were to step aside and some workman or workman’s servant were to come along and stand in his place. 
And standing there he might say: 
“This is what King Pasenadi of Kosala says!” 
Would he be speaking the King’s words,
 as if he were the King’s equal?’ 
‘No indeed, Reverend Gotama.’
^n285 ‘Well then, Ambattha, it is just the same thing. Those who were, as you say, the first sages of the Brahmins, the makers and expounders of the mantras, whose ancient verses are chanted, pronounced and collected by the Brahmins of today — Atthaka, Vamaka, Vamadeva, Vessamitta, Yamataggi, Angirasa, Bharadvaja, Vasettha, Kassapa, Bhagu^f153 — whose mantras are said to be passed on to you and your teacher:
 yet you do not thereby become a sage or one practised in the way of a sage — such a thing is not possible.
^n286 ‘What do you think, Ambattha?
 What have you heard said by Brahmins who are venerable, aged, the teachers of teachers? Those first sages...
, Atthaka, ... 
Bhagu — did they enjoy themselves, well-bathed, perfumed, their hair and beards trimmed, adorned with garlands and wreaths, dressed in white clothes, indulging in the pleasures of the five senses and addicted to them, as you and your teacher do now?’ 
‘No Reverend Gotama.’

‘Or did they eat special fine rice with the black spots removed, with various soups and curries, as you and your teacher do now?’
 ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’

‘Or did they amuse themselves with women dressed up in flounces and furbelows, as you and your teacher do now?’ 
‘No, Reverend Gotama.’

‘Or did they ride around in chariots drawn by mares with braided tails, that they urged on with long goad-sticks?’ 
‘No, Reverend Gotama.’

‘Or did they have themselves guarded in fortified towns with palisades and barricades, by men with long swords ... ?’
 ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
‘So, Ambattha, neither you nor your teacher are a sage or one trained in the way of a sage. 
And now, as for your doubts and perplexities concerning me, we will clarify these by your asking me, and by my answering your questions.’
^n287 Then, descending from his lodging, the Lord started to walk up and down,
 and Ambattha did likewise. 
And as he walked along with the Lord, Ambattha looked out for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the Lord’s body. 
And he could see all of them except for two. 
He was in doubt and perplexity about two of these marks: 
he could not make up his mind or be certain about the sheathed genitals or the large tongue.
^n288 And the Lord,
 being aware of his doubts,
 effected by his psychic power that
 Ambattha could see his sheathed genitals, and then, sticking out his tongue,
 he reached out to lick both ears and both nostrils,
 and then covered the whole circle of his forehead with his tongue. 
Then Ambattha thought: 
‘The ascetic Gotama is equipped with all the thirty-two marks of a Great Man, complete and with none missing.’ 
Then he said to the Lord:
 ‘Reverend Gotama, may I go now? I have much business, much to do.’ 
‘Ambattha, do what you now think fit.’ 
So Ambattha got back into his chariot drawn by mares and departed.
^n289 Meanwhile the Brahmin Pokkharasati had gone outside and was sitting in his park with a large number of Brahmins, just waiting for Ambattha.
 Then Ambattha came to the park.
 He rode in the chariot as far as it would go, and then continued on foot to where Pokkharasati was, saluted him,
^n290 and sat down to one side. Then Pokkharasati said:
‘Well, dear boy, did you see the Reverend Gotama?’
 ‘I did, sir.’
 ‘And was the Reverend Gotama such as he is reported to be, and not otherwise?
And is he of such nature, and not otherwise?’ 
‘Sir, he is as he is reported to be, and he is of such nature and not otherwise. 
He is possessed of the thirty-two marks of a Great Man, all complete, with none missing.’
‘But was there any conversation between you and the ascetic Gotama?’ 
‘There was, sir.’
‘And what was this conversation about?’ 
So Ambattha told Pokkharasati all that had passed between the Lord and himself.
^n291 At this Pokkharasāti exclaimed:
 ‘Well, you’re a fine little scholar, a fine wise man, a fine expert in the Three Vedas! Anyone going about his business like that ought when he dies, at the breaking-up of the body, to go to the downfall, to the evil path, to ruin, to hell! 
You have heaped insults on the Reverend Gotama, as a result of which he has brought up more and more things against us! 
You’re a fine little scholar ... !’
 He was so angry and enraged that he kicked Ambattha over,
^n292  and wanted to start out at once to see the Lord. But the Brahmins said:
 ‘It is far too late, sir, to go to see the ascetic Gotama today.
 The Reverend Pokkharasāti should go to see him tomorrow.’
 Then Pokkharasāti, having had fine hard and soft food prepared in his own home, set out by the light of torches from Ukkattha for the jungle of Icchānankala.
 He went by chariot as far as possible, then continued on foot to where the Lord was. Having exchanged courtesies with the Lord,
^n293 he sat down to one side and said:
 ‘Venerable Gotama, did not our pupil Ambattha come to see you?’
 ‘He did, Brahmin.’
 ‘And was there any conversation between you?’
‘There was.’ 
‘And what was this conversation about?’
Then the Lord told Pokkharasāti all that had passed between him and Ambattha. 
At this, Pokkharasāti said to the Lord: 
‘Reverend Gotama, Ambattha is a young fool. May the Reverend Gotama pardon him.’
 ‘Brahmin, may Ambattha be happy.’ 
^n294 Then Pokkharasāti looked out for the thirty-two marks of a Great Man on the Lord’s body and
 he could see all of them except for two: 

^i[the sheathed genitals and the large tongue; but the Lord set his mind at rest about these] (^i[as verse 11 — 12]). 
^n295 





^n296 And Pokkharasāti said to the Lord: 


‘May the Reverend Gotama accept a meal from me today together with his order of monks!’ 
And the Lord consented by silence.
^n297 Seeing his acceptance, Pokkharasāti said to the Lord:
 ‘It is time, Reverend Gotama, the meal is ready.’ 
And the Lord, having dressed in the early morning and taken his robe and bowl,^f154 went with his order of monks to Pokkharasāti’s residence, and sat down on the prepared seat. 
Then Pokkharasāti personally served the Lord with choice hard and soft food, and the young men served the monks. 
And when the Lord had taken his hand from the bowl, Pokkharasati sat down to one side on a low stool.
^n298 And as Pokkharasati sat there,
 the Lord delivered a graduated discourse on generosity, on morality and on heaven, showing the danger, degradation and corruption of sense-desires, and the profit of renunciation. 
And when the Lord knew that Pokkharasāti’s mind was ready, pliable, free from the hindrances, joyful and calm, then he preached a sermon on Dhamma in brief: 
on suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. 
And just as a clean cloth from which all stains have been removed receives the dye perfectly,
 so in the Brahmin Pokkharasati, as he sat there, there arose the pure and spotless Dhamma-eye, and he knew: 
‘Whatever things have an origin must come to cessation.’^f155
^n299 And Pokkharasati, having seen, attained, experienced and penetrated the Dhamma, having passed beyond doubt, transcended uncertainty, having gained perfect confidence in the Teacher’s doctrine without relying on others, said:
 ‘Excellent, Lord, excellent! 
It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there. 
Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways ... I go with my son, my wife, my ministers and counsellors for refuge to the Reverend Gotama, to the Dhamma and to the Sangha.^f156
 May the Reverend Gotama accept me as a lay-follower who has taken refuge from this day forth as long as life shall last! 
And whenever the Reverend Gotama visits other families or lay-followers in Ukkattha, may he also visit the family of Pokkharasati! 
Whatever young men and maidens are there will revere the Reverend Gotama and rise before him, will give him a seat and water and will be glad at heart, and that will be for their welfare and happiness for a long time.’
‘Well said, Brahmin!’

^ck#d4(^z1[Soṇadaṇḍa Sutta: About Soṇadaṇḍa] ^h[The Qualities of a True Brahmin] )^n300 THUS HAVE I HEARD.
 Once the Lord was travelling among the Angas with a large company of some five hundred monks, and he arrived at Campa. 
At Campa he stayed by Gaggara’s lotus-pond. 
At that time the Brahmin Sonadanda was living at Campa, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water and corn, which had been given to him by King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha as a royal gift and with royal powers.
^n301 And the Brahmins and householders of Campa heard say:
 ‘The ascetic Gotama of the Sakyans, who has gone forth from the Sakya clan is travelling among the Angas...and is staying by Gaggara’s lotus-pool. 
And concerning that Blessed Lord Gotama a good report has been spread about: 
“This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, perfected in knowledge and conduct, a Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, unequalled Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, a Buddha, a Blessed Lord.” 
He proclaims this world with its gods, maras, Brahmas, the world of ascetics and Brahmins with its princes and people, having come to know it by his own knowledge. 
He teaches a Dhamma that is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and he displays the fully-perfected, thoroughly purified holy life. 
And indeed it is good to see such Arahants.’ 
Thereupon the Brahmins and householders of Campa, leaving Campa in great crowds, in vast numbers, went to Gaggara’s lotus-pond.
^n302 Just then, the Brahmin Sonadanda had gone up to his verandah for his midday rest. 
Seeing all the Brahmins and householders making for Gaggarā’s lotus-pond,
 he asked his steward the reason.
‘Sir, it is the ascetic Gotama of the Sakyans ... 



That is why they are going to see him.’
‘Well then, steward, go to the Brahmins and householders of Campā and say to them: 
“Please wait, gentlemen,
 the Brahmin Sonadanda will come to see the ascetic Gotama.”’
And the steward conveyed this message to the Brahmins and householders of Campā.


^n303 Now at that time some five hundred Brahmins from various provinces were in Campā on some business,
 and they heard that
 Sonadanda intended to visit the ascetic Gotama. 
So they called upon him and asked
 if this were true. 
‘So it is, gentlemen,
 I am going to visit the ascetic Gotama.’
‘Sir, do not visit the ascetic Gotama,
 it is not fitting that you should do so! 
If the Reverend Sonadanda goes to visit the ascetic Gotama, his reputation will decrease, and that of the ascetic Gotama will increase. 
This being so, it is not right that the Reverend Sonadanda should visit the ascetic Gotama,
 but rather the ascetic Gotama should visit him.
‘The Reverend Sonadanda is well-born on both the mother’s and the father’s side, of pure descent to the seventh generation, unbroken, of irreproachable birth,
 and therefore he should not call on the ascetic Gotama,
 but rather the ascetic Gotama should call on him. 
The Reverend Sonadanda is possessed of great wealth and resources... 
The Reverend Sonadanda is a scholar, versed in the mantras, accomplished in the Three Vedas, a skilled expounder of the rules and rituals, the lore of sounds and meanings and, fifthly, oral tradition — an expounder, fully versed in natural philosophy and the marks of a Great Man. 
The Reverend Sonadanda is handsome, good-looking, pleasing, of the most beautiful complexion, in form and countenance like Brahmā, of no mean appearance. 
He is virtuous, of increasing virtue, endowed with increasing virtue. 
He is well-spoken, of pleasing address, polite, of pure and clear enunciation, speaking to the point. 
He is the teacher’s teacher of many, teaching the mantras to three hundred youths, and many young men come from different districts and regions seeking to learn the mantras in his presence, desirous to learn them from him. 
He is aged, grown old, venerable, advanced in years, long past his youth,
 whereas the ascetic Gotama is youthful and newly gone forth as a wanderer. 
The Reverend Sonadanda is esteemed, made much of, honoured, revered, worshipped by King Seniya Bimbisara
 and by the Brahmin Pokkharasati. 
He lives at Campa, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water and corn, which has been given to him by King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha as a royal gift, and with royal powers. 

This being so, it is not proper that he should visit the ascetic Gotama,
 but rather the ascetic Gotama should visit him.‘^f157 
^n304 At this Sonadanda replied: 
‘Now listen, gentlemen, as to why it is fitting for us to visit the Reverend Gotama,
 and why it is not fitting for him to visit us. 
The ascetic Gotama is well-born on both sides of pure descent to the seventh generation, unbroken, of it reproachable birth...(^i[as verse 5]). 
Therefore it is fitting for us to visit him. 

He went forth, leaving a great body of kinsmen. 
In fact he gave up much gold and wealth to go forth, both hidden away and openly displayed. 
The ascetic Gotama, while youthful, a black-haired youth, in the prime of his young days, in the first stage of life went forth from the household life into homelessness. 
Leaving his grieving parents weeping with tear-stained faces, having cut off his hair and beard and put on yellow robes, he went forth into homelessness. 
He is handsome,... 
virtuous,... 
well-spoken, ... 
the teacher’s teacher of many. 
He has abandoned sensuality and dispelled vanity. 
He teaches action and the results of action, honouring the blameless Brahmin way of life. 
He is a wanderer of high birth, of a leading Khattiya family. 
He is a wanderer from a wealthy family, of great wealth and possessions. 
People come to consult him from foreign kingdoms and foreign lands. 
Many thousands of devas have taken refuge with him.
‘This good report has been spread about him: 
“This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, perfected in knowledge and conduct...” (^i[as verse 2]). 
He bears the thirty-two marks of a Great Man. 
He is welcoming, kindly of speech, courteous, genial, clear and ready of speech. 
He is attended by four assemblies, revered, honoured, esteemed and worshipped by them. 
Many devas and humans are devoted to him. 
Whenever he stays in any town or village, that place is not troubled by non-human beings. 
He has a crowd, a multitude of followers, is a teacher of many, he is consulted by the chief of the various leaders of sects. 
It is not the way with the ascetic Gotama’s reputation, as it is with that of some ascetics and Brahmins, about whom this or that is reported — the ascetic Gotama’s fame is based on his achievement of unsurpassed wisdom and conduct. 
Indeed King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha has gone for refuge to him together with his son, his wife, his followers and his ministers. 
So have King Pasenadi of Kosala
 and the Brahmin Pokkharasati. 
He is revered, honoured, esteemed and worshipped by them. 


‘The ascetic Gotama has arrived in Campa and is staying by Gaggara’s lotus-pond. 
And whatever ascetics and Brahmins come to our territory are our guests. 
And we should revere, honour, esteem and worship guests. 

Having come to Gaggara’s lotus-pond, the ascetic Gotama is such a guest, and should be treated as such. 
Therefore it is not proper that he should come to us,
 but rather we should go to him. 
However much I might praise the ascetic Gotama, that praise is insufficient,
 he is beyond all praise.’
^n305  On hearing this, the Brahmins said to Sonadanda:
 ‘Sir, since you praise the ascetic Gotama so much, then even if he were to live a hundred yojanas from here, it would be fitting for a believing clansman to go with a shoulder-bag to visit him.
 And so, sir, we shall all go to visit the ascetic Gotama.’ 
^n306 And so Sonadanda went with a large company of Brahmins to Gaggarā’s lotus-pond. 
But when Sonadanda had traversed the jungle-thickets, he thought: 
‘If I ask the ascetic Gotama a question,
 he might say to me: 
“That, Brahmin, is not a fitting question, it is not at all a fitting question”, and then the company might despise me, saying: 
“Sonadanda is a fool, he has no sense, he can’t put a proper question to the ascetic Gotama.” 
And if anyone were despised by this company, his reputation would suffer,
 and then his income would suffer,
 for our income depends on the gaining of a reputation. 
Or if the ascetic Gotama were to ask me a question, my answer might not satisfy him,
 and he might say: 
“That is not the right way to answer this question.” 



And then the company might despise me ... 
And if, having come into the presence of the ascetic Gotama, I were to turn away without showing myself, this company might despise me...’




^n307 Then Sonadanda approached the Lord, exchanged courtesies with him,
 and sat down to one side. 
Some of the Brahmins and householders made obeisance to the Lord, some exchanged courtesies with him, some saluted him with joined palms, some announced their name and clan, and some sat down to one side in silence. 
^n308 So Sonadanda took his seat with many thoughts going through his mind: 
‘If I ask the ascetic Gotama a question, he might say to me: 
“That, Brahmin, is not a fitting question...” 












If only the ascetic Gotama would ask me a question from my own field of the Three Vedas! Then I could give him an answer that would satisfy him!’
^n309 And the Lord, reading his mind, thought:
 ‘This Sonadanda is worried.
 Suppose I were to ask him a question from his own field as a teacher of the Three Vedas!’ 
So he said to Sonadanda:
 ‘By how many qualities do Brahmins recognise a Brahmin? 
How would one declare truthfully and without falling into falsehood: “I am a Brahmin”?’
^n310 Then Sonadanda thought: 
‘Now what I wanted, hoped for, desired and longed for has happened... 

Now I can give him an answer that will satisfy him.’
^n311 Straightening up, and looking round the assembly, he said: 
‘Reverend Gotama, there are five such qualities... 

What are they? 
A Brahmin is well-born on both the mother’s and the father’s side, of pure descent to the seventh generation,... 
he is a scholar versed in the mantras, ... 
he is handsome, pleasing,... 
he is virtuous,... 
he is learned and wise, and is the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle. 
These are the five qualities of a true Brahmin.’

‘But if one of these five qualities were omitted, could not one be recognised as a true Brahmin, being possessed of four of these qualities?’

‘It is possible, Gotama. 
We could leave out appearance,
 for what does that matter? 




If a Brahmin had the other four qualities he could be recognised as a true Brahmin.’

^n312 ‘But could not one of these four qualities be omitted, leaving three whereby one could be recognised as a true Brahmin?’

‘It is possible, Gotama. 
We could leave out the mantras, for what do they matter? 
If he had the other three qualities he could be recognised as a true Brahmin.’





‘But could not one of these three qualities be omitted ... ?’ 

‘It is possible, Gotama. 
We could leave out birth,
 for what does that matter? 
If a Brahmin is virtuous, of increasing virtue, ... 
and if he is learned and wise, and is the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle —
 then he can be recognised as a true Brahmin and truthfully claim to be so.’ 

^n313 At this the Brahmins said to Sonadanda:
 ‘Don’t say that, Sonadanda don’t say it! 
The Reverend Sonadanda is decrying appearance, the mantras and birth, he is actually adopting the ascetic Gotama’s own words!’
^n314 Then the Lord said to the Brahmins: 
‘If you think
 the Brahmin Sonadanda is not concentrating on his task, is using wrong words, is lacking in wisdom, and is not fit to converse with the ascetic Gotama, then let him cease, and you talk to me. 
But if you think
 he is learned, speaks properly, is wise and fit to converse with the ascetic Gotama, then you cease and let him speak.’
^n315 Then Sonadanda said to the Lord:
 ‘Let that be, Reverend Gotama, and be silent. I will answer in this matter.’ 
To the Brahmins he said: 
‘Do not say the Reverend Sonadanda is decrying appearance... 
and adopting the ascetic Gotama’s own words! 
I do not decry appearance, mantras, or birth.’
^n316 Now at that time Sonadanda’s nephew, a young man called Angaka, was sitting in the assembly,
 and Sonadanda said: 
‘Gentlemen, do you see my nephew Angaka?’ 
‘Yes, sir.’ 
‘Angaka is handsome, good-looking, pleasing, of supremely fair complexion, in form and countenance like Brahmā, of no mean appearance, and there is none in this assembly his equal except the ascetic Gotama. 
He is a scholar...
I was his mantra-teacher. 
He is well-born on both sides... 
I know his parents. 
But if Angaka were to take life, take what is not given, commit adultery, tell lies and drink strong drink — what would good looks, or mantras, or birth profit him? 
But it is because a Brahmin is virtuous,... 
because he is wise ... :
 on account of these two points that he can truthfully declare: 
“I am a Brahmin.”’
^n317 ‘But, Brahmin, if one were to omit one of these two points, could one truthfully declare: 
“I am a Brahmin”?’ 
‘No, Gotama. 
For wisdom is purified by morality, and morality is purified by wisdom: 
where one is, the other is,
 the moral man has wisdom and the wise man has morality,
 and the combination of morality and wisdom is called the highest thing in the world. 
Just as one hand washes the other, or one foot the other,
 so wisdom is purified by morality and this combination is called the highest thing in the world.’



‘So it is, Brahmin. Wisdom is purified by morality, and morality is purified by wisdom: 
where one is, the other is,
 the moral man has wisdom and the wise man has morality,
 and the combination of morality and wisdom is called the highest thing in the world. 





^n318 But, Brahmin, what is this morality
 and what is this wisdom?’
‘We only know this much, Gotama. 
It would be well if the Reverend Gotama were to explain the meaning of this.’
‘Then listen, Brahmin, pay proper attention, and I will tell you.’ 
‘Yes, sir’, said Sonadanda in reply,
 and the Lord said:
‘Brahmin, a Tathagata arises in this world, an Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed. He, having realised it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world with its devas, maras and Brahmas, its princes and people. He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life. 
^i[A disciple goes forth and practises the moralities] (^i[Sutta]2^i[, verses 41 — 63); he guards the sensedoors, etc.] (^i[Sutta 2], ^i[verses 64 — 74]). 
That, Brahmin, is morality.^f158
^i[He attains the four jhānas] (^i[Sutta 2], verses75 — 82);



 ^i[he attains various insights] (^i[Sutta 2],
 ^i[verses 83 — 95), and the cessation of the]^i[corruptions] (^i[Sutta 2], ^i[verse 97]). 

Thus he develops wisdom. 
That, Brahmin, is wisdom.’
^n319 At these words Sonadanda said:
 ‘Excellent, Lord, excellent
! It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there. Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways. 
And I go for refuge to the Blessed Lord Gotama, to the Dhamma and to the Sangha. 
May the Reverend Gotama accept me from this day forth as a lay-follower as long as life shall last!
 And may the Reverend Gotama and his order of monks accept a meal from me tomorrow! ’
 The Lord assented by silence. 
^n320 Then Sonadanda, seeing his assent, rose, saluted the Lord, passed by to his right and departed. 
As day was breaking, he caused hard and soft food to be prepared in his own home, and when it was ready he announced: 
‘Reverend Gotama, it is time; the meal is ready.’
And the Lord, having risen early, went with robe and bowl and attended by his monks to Sonadanda’s residence and sat down on the prepared seat.
 And Sonadanda served the Buddha and his monks with the finest foods with his own hands until they were satisfied.
^n321 And when the Lord had eaten and taken his hand away from the bowl, Sonadanda took a low stool and sat down to one side.
 Then he said to the Lord:
 ‘Reverend Gotama, if when I have gone into the assembly I were to rise and salute the Lord, the company would despise me. 
In that case my reputation would suffer,
 and if a man’s reputation suffers,
 his income suffers ... 
So if, on entering the assembly, I should join my palms in greeting, may the Reverend Gotama take it as if I had risen from my seat. 
And if on entering the assembly I should take off my turban, may you take it as if I had bowed at your feet. 
Or if, when riding in my carriage, I were to alight to salute the Lord, the company would despise me ... 


So if, when I am riding in my carriage, I raise my goad, may you take it as if I had alighted from my carriage,
 and if I lower my hand, may you take it as if I had bowed my head at your feet.’^f159
^n322 Then the Lord, having instructed Sonadanda with a talk on Dhamma, inspired him, fired him with enthusiasm and delighted him, rose from his seat and departed.

^ck#d5(^z1[Kūṭtadanta Sutta: About Kūṭadanta] ^h[A Bloodless Sacrifice] )^n323 THUS HAVE I HEARD.
 Once the Lord was travelling through Magadha with a large company of some five hundred monks, and he arrived at a Brahmin village called Khānumata.
 And there he stayed at the Ambalatthika park.^f160
 Now at that time the Brahmin Kutadanta was living at Khanumata, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water and corn, which had been given to him by King Seniya Bimbisara of Magadha as a royal gift and with royal powers.
And Kutadanta planned a great sacrifice: 
seven hundred bulls, seven hundred bullocks, seven hundred heifers, seven hundred he-goats and seven hundred rams were all tied up to the sacrificial posts.^f161
^n324 And the Brahmins and householders of Khānumata heard say:
 ‘The ascetic Gotama...is staying at Ambalatthika. 
And concerning that Blessed Lord Gotama a good report has been spread about: 
“This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, perfected in knowledge and conduct, a Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, unequalled Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, a Buddha, a Blessed Lord.” 
He proclaims this world with its gods, maras and Brahmas, the world of ascetics and Brahmins with its princes and people, having come to know it by his own knowledge. 
He teaches a Dhamma that is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and he displays the fully-perfected, thoroughly purified holy life. 
And indeed it is good to see such Arahants.’ 
^n325  And at that the Brahmins and householders, leaving Khānumata in great numbers, went to Ambalatthika.
^n326 Just then, Kutadanta had gone up to his verandah for his midday rest. 
Seeing all the Brahmins and householders making for Ambalaṭṭhikā,
 he asked his steward the reason. 
The steward replied: ‘Sir, it is the ascetic Gotama, concerning whom a good report has been spread about: 
^n327
 
“This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, ... a Buddha, a Blessed Lord”. 
That is why they are going to see him.’
^n328 Then Kūṭadanta thought: 
‘I have heard that
 the ascetic Gotama understands how to conduct successfully the triple sacrifice with its sixteen requisites. 
Now I do not understand all this,
 but I want to make a big sacrifice. 
Suppose I were to go to the ascetic Gotama and ask him about the matter.’ 
^n329 So he sent his steward to the Brahmins and householders of Khānumata to ask them to wait for him.






^n330 And at that time several hundred Brahmins were staying at Khānumata
 intending to take part in Kūṭadanta’s sacrifice. 
Hearing of his intention
  to visit the ascetic Gotama,
 they went and 
^n331 asked him if this were true. 

‘So it is, gentlemen,
 I am going to visit the ascetic Gotama.’
‘Sir, do not visit the ascetic Gotama...(^i[exactly the same arguments as at Sutta]4^i[, verse]5). 
This being so, it is not proper that the Reverend Kūṭadanta should visit the ascetic Gotama, but rather the ascetic Gotama should visit him.’



















^n332 Then Kūṭadanta said to the Brahmins: 
‘Now listen, gentlemen, as to why it is fitting for us to visit the Reverend Gotama, and why it is not fitting for him to visit us... (^i[exactly the same as Sutta]4^i[, verse 6]). 

































The ascetic Gotama has arrived in Khānumata and is staying at Ambalaṭṭhikā. 
And whatever ascetics or Brahmins come to our territory are our guests ... 






He is beyond all praise.’
^n333 On hearing this, the Brahmins said:
 ‘Sir, since you praise the ascetic Gotama so much, then even if he were to live a hundred yojanas from here, it would be fitting for a believing clansman to go with a shoulder-bag to visit him.
 And, sir, we shall all go to visit the ascetic Gotama.’
^n334  And so Kūṭadanta went with a large company of Brahmins to Ambalaṭṭhikā. He approached the Lord, exchanged courtesies with him,
 and sat down to one side. 
Some of the Brahmins and householders of Khānumata made obeisance to the Lord, some exchanged courtesies with him, some saluted him with joined palms, some announced their name and clan, and some sat down to one side in silence.
^n335 Sitting to one side, Kūtadanta addressed the Lord: 
‘Reverend Gotama, I have heard that
 you understand how to conduct successfully the triple sacrifice with its sixteen requisites. 
Now I do not understand all this,
 but I want to make a big sacrifice. 
It would be well if the ascetic Gotama were to explain this to me.’ 
^n336  ‘Then listen, Brahmin, pay proper attention, and I will explain.’ 
‘Yes, sir’, said Kūṭadanta,
 and the Lord said:
‘Brahmin, once upon a time there was a king called Mahāvijita.^f162 He was rich, of great wealth and resources, with an abundance of gold and silver, of possessions and requisites, of money and money’s worth, with a full treasury and granary. 
And when King Mahāvijita was musing in private, the thought came to him: 
“I have acquired extensive wealth in human terms, I occupy a wide extent of land which I have conquered. 
^n337 Suppose now I were to make a great sacrifice which would be to my benefit and happiness for a long time?” And calling his minister-chaplain,^f163
 he told him his thought. 

“1 want to make a big sacrifice. 
Instruct me, Reverend Sir, how this may be to my lasting benefit and happiness.”
^n338 ‘The chaplain replied: 
“Your Majesty’s country is beset by thieves, it is ravaged, villages and towns are being destroyed, the countryside is infested with brigands. 
If Your Majesty were to tax this region, that would be the wrong thing to do. 
Suppose Your Majesty were to think: 
‘I will get rid of this plague of robbers by executions and imprisonment, or by confiscation, threats and banishment’, the plague would not be properly ended. 
Those who survived would later harm Your Majesty’s realm. 
However, with this plan you can completely eliminate the plague. 
To those in the kingdom who are engaged in cultivating crops and raising cattle,
 let Your Majesty distribute grain and fodder;
 to those in trade, give capital; to those in government service assign proper living wages. 
Then those people, being intent on their own occupations, will not harm the kingdom. 
Your Majesty’s revenues will be great,
 the land will be tranquil and not beset by thieves, and the people, with joy in their hearts, will play with their children, and will dwell in open houses.”
‘And saying: “So be it!”, the king accepted the chaplain’s advice: 
he gave grain and fodder, capital to those in trade,... proper living wages... and the people with joy in their hearts ... dwelt in open houses.



 ‘Then King Mahāvijita sent for the chaplain and said:
 “I have got rid of the plague of robbers; following your plan my revenue has grown,
 the land is tranquil and not beset by thieves, and the people with joy in their hearts play with their children and dwell in open houses.
 Now I wish to make a great sacrifice.
 Instruct me as to how this may be done to my lasting benefit and happiness.” 
^n339“For this, Sire, you should send for your Khattiyas from town and country, your advisers and counsellors, the most influential Brahmins and the wealthy householders of your realm, and say to them: 
‘I wish to make a great sacrifice. 
Assist me in this, gentlemen, that it may be to my lasting benefit and happiness.’”
‘The King agreed, and did so. 
“Sire, let the sacrifice begin, now is the time, Your Majesty. 



These four assenting groups^f164 will be the accessories for the sacrifice.
^n340 “‘King Mahāvijita is endowed with eight things.
 He is well-born on both sides,... (^i[as Sutta 4], ^i[verse 5]) of irreproachable birth.
 He is handsome, ... of no mean appearance.
 He is rich ... with a full treasury and granary. 
He is powerful, having a four-branched army^f165 that is loyal, dependable, making bright his reputation among his enemies. 
He is a faithful giver and host, not shutting his door against ascetics, Brahmins and wayfarers, beggars and the needy — a fountain of goodness. 
He is very learned in what should be learnt. 
He knows the meaning of whatever is said, saying: ‘This is what that means.’ 
He is a scholar, accomplished, wise, competent to perceive advantage in the past, the future or the present. ^f166
 King Mahāvijita is endowed with these eight things.
 These constitute the accessories for the sacrifice.
^n341 “‘The Brahmin chaplain is endowed with four things.
 He is well-born...
He is a scholar, versed in the mantras ... 
He is virtuous, of increasing virtue, endowed with increasing virtue. 
He is learned, accomplished and wise, and is the first or second to hold the sacrificial ladle. 
He has these four qualities. 
These constitute the accessories to the sacrifice.”
^n342 ‘Then, prior to the sacrifice, the Brahmin chaplain taught the King the three modes. 
“It might be that Your Majesty might have some regrets about the intended sacrifice: 
‘I am going to lose a lot of wealth’, or during the sacrifice: 
‘I am losing a lot of wealth’, or after the sacrifice: 
‘I have lost a lot of wealth.’ 


In such cases, Your Majesty should not entertain such regrets.”
^n343 ‘Then, prior to the sacrifice, the chaplain dispelled the King’s qualms with ten conditions for the recipient: 
“Sire, there will come to the sacrifice those who take life and those who abstain from taking life. 
To those who take life, so will it be to them; 
but those who abstain from taking life will have a successful sacrifice and will rejoice in it, and their hearts may be calmed within. 
There will come those who take what is not given and those who refrain...
, those who indulge in sexual misconduct and those who refrain...
, those who tell lies...
, indulge in calumny,
 harsh
 and frivolous speech...
, those who are covetous and those who are not,
 those who harbour ill-will and those who do not,
 those who have wrong views and those who have right views. 
To those who have wrong views it will turn out accordingly,
 but those who have right views will have a successful sacrifice and will rejoice in it, and their hearts may be calmed within.” 
So the chaplain dispelled the King’s doubts with ten conditions.
^n344 ‘So the chaplain instructed the King who was making the great sacrifice with sixteen reasons, urged him, inspired him and gladdened his heart.
 “Someone might say: 
‘King Mahāvijita is making a great sacrifice, but he has not invited his Khattiyas...,


 


his advisers and counsellors, the most influential Brahmins and wealthy householders...’ 

But such words would not be in accordance with the truth, since the King has invited them. 
Thus the King may know that he will have a successful sacrifice and rejoice in it, and his heart will be calmed within. 
Or someone might say: 
‘King Mahāvijita is making a great sacrifice, but he is not well-born on both sides...’
But such words would not be in accordance with the truth... 
Or someone might say: 
‘His chaplain is not well-born...’ 
But such words would not be in accordance with the truth.” 
Thus the chaplain instructed the King with sixteen reasons...


























^n345 ‘In this sacrifice, Brahmin, no bulls were slain, no goats or sheep, no cocks and pigs, nor were various living beings subjected to slaughter, nor were trees cut down for sacrificial posts, nor were grasses mown for the sacrificial grass,
 and those who are called slaves or servants or workmen did not perform their tasks for fear of blows or threats, weeping and in tears. 
But those who wanted to do something did it, those who did not wish to did not: 
they did what they wanted to do, and not what they did not want to do. 
The sacrifice was carried out with ghee, oil, butter, curds, honey and molasses. 
^n346 ‘Then, Brahmin, the Khattiyas ... , the ministers and counsellors, the influential Brahmins, the wealthy householders of town and country, having received a sufficient income, came to King Mahāvijita and said:
 “We have brought sufficient wealth, Your Majesty, please accept it.”
 “But, gentlemen, I have collected together sufficient wealth. Whatever is left over, you take away.”
‘At the King’s refusal, they went away to one side and consulted together: 

“It is not right for us to take this wealth back to our own homes. 
The King is making a great sacrifice. Let us follow his example.”
^n347 ‘Then the Khattiyas put their gifts to the east of the sacrificial pit,
 the advisers and counsellors set out theirs to the south,
 the Brahmins to the west and
 the wealthy householders to the north. 
And in this sacrifice no bulls were slain,... 
nor were living beings subjected to slaughter...
Those who wanted to do something did it, those who did not wish to did not... 

The sacrifice was carried out with ghee, oil, butter, curds, honey and molasses. 
Thus there were the four assenting groups, and King Mahāvijita was endowed with eight things, and the chaplain with four things
 in three modes. 
This, Brahmin, is called the sixteenfold successful sacrifice in three modes.’
^n348 At this the Brahmins shouted loudly and noisily:
 ‘What a splendid sacrifice! What a splendid way to perform a sacrifice! 
’ But Kutadanta sat in silence. 
And the Brahmins asked him
 why he did not applaud the ascetic Gotama’s fine words. 
He replied: ‘It is not that I do not applaud them. 
My head would split open if I did not.^f167
 But it strikes me that
 the ascetic Gotama does not say: 
“I have heard this”, or “It must have been like this”
, but he says: 
“It was like this or like that at the time.” 
And so, gentlemen,
 it seems to me that the ascetic Gotama must have been at that time either King Mahavijita, the lord of the sacrifice, or else the Brahmin chaplain who conducted the sacrifice for him. 
Does the Reverend Gotama acknowledge that he performed, or caused to be performed, such a sacrifice, and that in consequence at death, after the breaking-up of the body, he was reborn in a good sphere, a heavenly state?’ 
‘I do, Brahmin. I was the Brahmin chaplain who conducted that sacrifice.’
^n349 ‘And, Reverend Gotama, is there any other sacrifice that is simpler, less difficult, more fruitful and profitable than this threefold sacrifice with its sixteen attributes?’
 ‘There is, Brahmin.’
‘What is it, Reverend Gotama?’ 
‘Wherever regular family gifts are given to virtuous ascetics,
 these constitute a sacrifice more fruitful and profitable than that.’
‘Why, Reverend Gotama, and for what reason is this better?’
‘Brahmin, no Arahants or those who have attained the Arahant path will attend such a sacrifice. 
Why? 
Because there they see beatings and throttlings, so they do not attend. 

But they will attend the sacrifice at which regular family gifts are given to virtuous ascetics, because there there are no beatings or throttlings. 


That is why this kind of sacrifice is more fruitful and profitable.’
^n350 ‘But, Reverend Gotama, is there any other sacrifice that is more profitable than either of these?’
 ‘There is, Brahmin.’ 
‘What is it, Reverend Gotama?’ 
‘Brahmin, if anyone provides shelter for the Sangha coming from the four quarters, that constitutes a more profitable sacrifice.’
^n351 ‘But, Reverend Gotama, is there any sacrifice that is more profitable than these three?’ ‘There is, Brahmin.’

‘What is it, Reverend Gotama?’ 
‘Brahmin, if anyone with a pure heart goes for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, that constitutes a sacrifice more profitable than any of these three.’

^n352 ‘But, Reverend Gotama, is there any sacrifice that is more profitable than these four?’ 
‘There is, Brahmin.’
‘What is it, Reverend Gotama?’ 
‘Brahmin, if anyone with a pure heart undertakes the precepts —
 to refrain from taking life, from taking what is not given, from sexual immorality, from lying speech and from taking strong drink and sloth-producing drugs — that constitutes a sacrifice more profitable than any of these four.’

^n353 ‘But, Reverend Gotama, is there any sacrifice that is more profitable than these five?’ 
‘There is, Brahmin.’
  ‘What is it, Reverend Gotama?’ 
‘Brahmin, a Tathagata arises in this world, an Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed. 
He, having realised it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world with its devas, maras and Brahmas, its princes and people. 
He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life. 
A ^i[disciple goes forth and practises the moralities, etc.] (^i[Sutta 2, verses 41 — 74]). Thus a monk is perfected in morality.
 ^i[He attains the four jhānas] (^i[Sutta]2^i[, verses 75 — 82]). 
That, Brahmin, is a sacrifice ... more profitable. 


^i[He attains various insights] (^i[Sutta]2^i[, verse 83 — 95])^i[, and the cessation of the corruptions] (^i[Sutta]2^i[, verse 97)]. 

He knows: “There is nothing further in this world.” 
That, Brahmin, is a sacrifice that is simpler, less difficult, more fruitful and more profitable than all the others. 
And beyond this there is no sacrifice that is greater and more perfect.’
^n354
 ‘Excellent, Reverend Gotama, excellent! 
It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there.
 Just so the Reverend Gotama has expounded the Dhamma in various ways, May the Reverend Gotama accept me as a lay-follower from this day forth as long as life shall last! 
And, Reverend Gotama, I set free the seven hundred bulls, seven hundred bullocks, seven hundred heifers, seven hundred he-goats and seven hundred rams. 
I grant them life, let them be fed with green grass and given cool water to drink, and let cool breezes play upon them.’
^n355 Then the Lord delivered a graduated discourse to Kūṭadanta,
 on generosity, on morality and on heaven, showing the danger, degradation and corruption of sense-desires, and the profit of renunciation. 
And when the Lord knew that Kūṭadanta’s mind was ready, pliable, free from the hindrances, joyful and calm, then he preached a sermon on Dhamma in brief: 
on suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path.
 And just as a clean cloth from which all stains have been removed receives the dye perfectly,
 so in the Brahmin Kūṭadanta, as he sat there, there arose the pure and spotless Dhamma-eye, and he knew: 
‘Whatever things have an origin must come to cessation.
^n356 ’Then Kūṭadanta, having seen, attained, experienced and penetrated the Dhamma, having passed beyond doubt, transcended uncertainty, having gained perfect confidence in the Teacher’s doctrine without relying on others, said:
 ‘May the Reverend Gotama and his order of monks accept a meal from me tomorrow!’
  The Lord assented by silence. 
^n357  Then Kūṭadanta, seeing his consent, rose, saluted the Lord, passed by to his right and departed. 
As day was breaking, he caused hard and soft food to be prepared at his place of sacrifice, and when it was ready he announced: 
‘Reverend Gotama, it is time; the meal is ready.’
^n358 And the Lord, having risen early, went with robe and bowl and attended by his monks to Kūṭadanta’s place of sacrifice and sat down on the prepared seat. 
And Kūṭadanta served the Buddha and his monks with the finest foods with his own hands until they were satisfied. 
And when the Lord had eaten and taken his hand away from the bowl, Kūṭadanta took a low stool and sat down to one side.
 Then the Lord, having instructed Kūṭadanta with a talk on Dhamma, inspired him, fired him with enthusiasm and delighted him, rose from his seat and departed.^f168

^ck#d6(^z1[Mahāli Sutta: About Mahāli] ^h[Heavenly Sights, Soul and Body] )^n359 THUS HAVE I HEARD.
 Once the Lord was staying at Vesālī, at the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest. 
And at that time a large number of Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha were staying at Vesālī on some business. 
And they heard say: 
‘The ascetic Gotama, son of the Sakyans, who has gone forth from the Sakya clan, is staying at Vesālī, at the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest. 
And concerning that Blessed Lord a good report has been spread about: 
“This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, perfected in knowledge and conduct, a Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, unequalled Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, a Buddha, a Blessed Lord.” 
He proclaims this world with its gods, māras and Brahmas, the world of ascetics and Brahmins with its princes and peoples, having come to know it by his own knowledge. 
He teaches a Dhamma that is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle and lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and he displays the fully-perfected, thoroughly purified holy life. 
And indeed it is good to see such Arahants.’
^n360 And so these Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha went to the Great Forest, to the Gabled Hall.
 At that time the Venerable Nāgita was the Lord’s personal attendant.
 So they approached the Venerable Nāgita and said:
 ‘Reverend Nāgita, where is the Reverend Gotama now staying? 
We would like to see him.’ 
‘Friends, it is not the right time to see the Lord. He is in solitary meditation.’ 
But the Brahmins just sat down to one side and said: 
‘When we have seen the Lord Gotama, we will go.’
^n361 Just then Otthaddha the Licchavi came to the Gabled Hall with a large company, saluted the Venerable Nāgita and stood aside, saying:
 ‘Where is the Blessed Lord staying, the Arahant, the fully-enlightened Buddha? 
We would like to see him.’ 
‘Mahāli,^f169 it is not the right time to see the Lord, He is in solitary meditation.’ 
But Otthaddha just sat down to one side, and said: 
‘When I have seen the Blessed Lord, the Arahant, the fully-enlightened Buddha, I will go.’
^n362 Then the novice Sīha^f170 came to the Venerable Nāgita, stood aside and said: 
‘Venerable Kassapa,^f171 these many Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha have come here to see the Lord, and Otthaddha the Licchavi, too, has come with a large company to see the Lord. It would be well, Venerable Kassapa, to allow these people to see him.’
 ‘Well then, Siha, you announce them to the Lord.’ 
‘Yes, Venerable Sir’, said Siha. Then he went to the Lord, saluted him, stood aside and said: 

‘Lord, these Brahmin emissaries from Kosala and Magadha have come here to see the Lord, and Otthaddha the Licchavi likewise with a large company. It would be well if the Lord were to let these people see him.’ 
‘Then, Siha, prepare a seat in the shade of this dwelling.’ 
‘Yes, Lord’, said Siha, and did so. 
^n363  Then the Lord came out of his dwelling-place and sat down on the prepared seat.
The Brahmins approached the Lord.
 Having exchanged courtesies with him, they sat down to one side.
 But Otthaddha did obeisance to the Lord, and then sat down to one side, saying: ‘Lord, not long ago Sunakkhatta the Licchavi^f172 came to me and said: 
^n364 “Soon I shall have been a follower of the Lord for three years.
I have seen heavenly sights, pleasant, delightful, enticing, but I have not heard any heavenly sounds that were pleasant, delightful, enticing.” 
Lord, are there any such heavenly sounds, which Sunakkhatta cannot hear, or are there not?’ 
^n365  ‘Then, Lord, what is the reason, what is the cause why Sunakkahtta cannot hear them?’ 
‘Mahāli, in one case a monk, facing east, goes into one-sided samādhi^f173 and sees heavenly sights, pleasant, delightful, enticing... 
^n366 but does not hear heavenly sounds. 

By means of this one-sided samadhi he sees heavenly sights but does not hear heavenly sounds. 
Why is this? 
Because this samādhi only leads to the seeing of heavenly sights, but not to the hearing of heavenly sounds.
^n367 ‘Again, a monk facing south, west, north goes into a one-sided samādhi and facing upwards, downwards or across sees heavenly sights
 〔in that direction〕,
 


but does not hear heavenly sounds. 
Why is this? 
Because this samādhi only leads to the seeing of heavenly sights, but not to the hearing of heavenly sounds. 
^n368 ‘In another case, Mahāli, a monk facing east...
hears heavenly sounds but does not see heavenly sights...



^n369 ‘Again, a monk facing south, west, north, facing upwards, downwards or across hears heavenly sounds, but does not see heavenly sights...







^n370 ‘In another case, Mahāli, a monk facing east goes into two-sided samādhi and both sees heavenly sights, pleasant, delightful, enticing and hears heavenly sounds. 


Why is this? 
Because this two-sided samadhi leads to both the seeing of heavenly sights and the hearing of heavenly sounds.
^n371 ‘Again, a monk facing south, west, north, facing upwards, downwards or across sees heavenly sights and hears heavenly sounds ... 







And that is the reason why Sunakkhatta comes to see heavenly sights but not to hear heavenly sounds.’^f174
^n372 ‘Well, Lord, is it for the realisation of such samādhistates that monks lead the holy life under the Blessed Lord?’ 
‘No, Mahāli, there are other things, higher and more perfect than these, for the sake of which monks lead the holy life under me.’

^n373 ‘What are they, Lord?’ 
‘Mahāli, in one case a monk, having abandoned three fetters, becomes a Stream-Winner, not liable to states of woe,
 firmly set on the path to enlightenment. 
Again, a monk who has abandoned the three fetters, and has reduced his greed, hatred and delusion, becomes a Once-Returner who, having returned to this world once more, will make an end of suffering. 

Again, a monk who has abandoned the five lower fetters takes a spontaneous rebirth ^f175 〔in a higher sphere〕 and, without returning from that world, gains enlightenment. 

Again, a monk through the extinction of the corruptions reaches in this very life the uncorrupted deliverance of mind, the deliverance through wisdom, which he has realised by his own insight. 

That is another thing higher and more perfect than these, for the sake of which monks lead the holy life under me.’
^n374 ‘Lord, is there a path, is there a method for the realisation of these things?’ ‘There is a path, Mahāli, there is a method.’ 
‘And, Lord, what is this path, what is this method?’
^n375
  ‘It is the Noble Eightfold Path,
 namely Right View, Right Thought; Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood; Right Effort, Right Mindfulness and Right Concentration. 
This is the path, this is the way to the realisation of these things.’
^n376 ‘Once, Mahāli, I was staying at Kosambi, in the Ghosita Park.
 And two wanderers,
 Mandissa and Jāliya, the pupil of the wooden-bowl ascetic, came to me, exchanged courtesies with me,
 and sat down to one side. Then they said:
 “How is it, friend Gotama, is the soul^f176 the same as the body, or is the soul one thing and the body another?” 
^n377 “Well now, friends, you listen, pay proper attention, and I will explain.”
 “Yes, friend”, they said,
 and I went on:
‘“Friends, a Tathagata arises in the world, an Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed. He, having realised it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world with its devas, maras and Brahmas, its princes and people. He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life. 
‘“^i[A disciple goes forth and practises the moralities (Sutta] 2^i[, verses 41 — 63]). On account of his morality, he sees no danger anywhere. He experiences in himself the blameless bliss that comes from maintaining this Ariyan morality. In this way, he is perfected in morality. (^i[as Sutta]2^i[, verses 64 — 74]) ...
It is as if he were freed from debt, from sickness, from bonds, from slavery, from the perils of the desert... 
Being thus detached from sense-desires, detached from unwholesome states, he enters and remains in the first jhāna ... and so suffuses, drenches, fills and irradiates his body, that there is no spot in his entire body that is untouched by this delight and joy born of detachment. 
Now of one who thus knows and thus sees, is it proper to say: 
‘The soul is the same as the body’, or ‘The soul is different from the body’?” 
“It is not, friend.”^f177
 
“But I thus know and see,
 and I do not say that
 the soul is either the same as, or different from the body.”
‘“And the same with the second...
, the third...
, the fourth jhāna (^i[as Sutta 2, verses 77 — 82]).







‘“The mind bends and tends towards knowledge and vision. 
Now, of one who thus knows and thus sees, is it proper to say: 
‘The soul is the same as the body’, or ‘The soul is different from the body’?” 

“It is not, friend.”
‘“He knows: 
‘There is nothing further here.’ 
Now of one who thus knows and thus sees, is it proper to say: 
‘The soul is the same as the body’, or ‘The soul is different from the body’?” 



“It is not, friend.” 

“But I thus know and see,
 and I do not say that
 the soul is either the same as, or different from the body.”’
 Thus the Lord spoke,
 and Otthaddha the Licchavi rejoiced at his words.

 Once the Lord was staying at Ujuññāya in the deer-park of Kaṇṇakatthale.^f180
 There the naked ascetic Kassapa came to him, exchanged courtesies with him, and stood to one side. 
Then he said:
‘Friend Gotama, I have heard it said:
 “The ascetic Gotama disapproves of all austerities, and censures and blames all those who lead a harsh life of self-mortification.^f181 Now are those who say this telling the truth, and do they not slander the Lord Gotama with lies? 
Do they explain the truth about his Dhamma and what pertains to it, or does some fellow-teacher of a different sect deserve to be blamed for this statement? 
We would like to see the Lord Gotama refute this charge.”
^n382 ‘Kassapa, those who say this are not telling the truth, they slander me with lies. The situation occurs, Kassapa, that I see one practiser of mortification,
 and with the divine eye^f182 which is purified beyond the sight of humans I see him arising after death, at the breaking-up of the body, in a place of woe, a baleful state, a place of destruction, in hell.
 Again, I see one practiser of mortification... arising after death in a good place, a heavenly state.
^n383  Again, I see one who practises little austerity ... arising in a state of woe ...
 Again, I see one who practises little austerity... arising after death in a good place, a heavenly state. 
Since I can see as it is the arising, the destiny, the death and re-arising of those ascetics, how could I disapprove of all austerities, and censure and blame all those who lead a harsh life of self-mortification?
^n384 ‘Kassapa, there are some ascetics and Brahmins who are wise, skilled, practised in disputation, splitters of hairs, acute, who walk cleverly along the paths of views. 
Sometimes their views accord with mine, sometimes they do not. 
What they sometimes applaud, we sometimes applaud. 
What they sometimes do not applaud, we sometimes do not applaud;
 what they sometimes applaud, we sometimes do not applaud,
 and what they sometimes do not applaud, we sometimes applaud. 
What we sometimes applaud, they sometimes applaud,
 what we sometimes do not applaud, they sometimes do not applaud. 
What we sometimes applaud, they sometimes do not applaud,
 and what we sometimes do not applaud, they sometimes applaud.
^n385 ‘On approaching them I say:
 “In these things there is no agreement, let us leave them aside.
 In these things there is agreement: there let the wise take up, cross-question and criticise these matters with the teachers or with their followers, saying: 
‘Of those things that are unskilful^f183 and reckoned as such, censurable, to be refrained from, unbefitting a Noble One, black, and reckoned as such —
 who is there who has completely abandoned such things and is free from them: the ascetic Gotama, or some other venerable teachers?’”
^n386 ‘It may be that the wise... say:
 “Of those things that are unskilled...
the ascetic Gotama has completely freed himself, but the other reverend teachers only in part.” 
In this case the wise give us the greatest share of praise.
^n387 ‘Or the wise may say: 
“Of those things that are skilled and reckoned as such, blameless, to be practised, fitting for a Noble One, bright and reckoned as such,
 who is there who has completely mastered them — the ascetic Gotama, or some other reverend teachers?”
^n388 ‘Or the wise may say:
 “Of these things ... 
the ascetic Gotama has completely mastered them, but the other reverend teachers only in part.” 
In this case the wise give us the greatest share of praise.

‘the order of the ascetic Gotama’s disciples, or that of the other reverend teachers.’) 

^n390 



^n391 


^n392 



^n393 ‘Kassapa, there is a path, there is a course of training, whereby one who has followed it will know and see for himself: 
“The ascetic Gotama speaks at the proper time, what is true, to the point^f184 — the Dhamma and the discipline.” 
What is this path and this course of training? 
It is the Noble Eightfold Path, namely Right View, Right Thought; Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood; Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, Right Concentration. 
This is the path whereby one may know and see for oneself: 
“The ascetic Gotama speaks at the proper time, what is true, to the point — the Dhamma and the discipline.”’

^n394 At this, Kassapa said to the Lord: 
‘Gotama, these ascetic practices of certain practisers of self-mortification are considered proper to them: 
a naked ascetic uses no polite restraints, ^f185 licks his hands, does not come or stand still when requested. 
He does not accept food offered or prepared for him, or an invitation to a meal. He does not accept food out of the pot or pan, nor on the threshold, among the firewood or the rice-pounders, nor where two people are eating, from a pregnant or nursing woman or from one living with a man, nor from gleanings, from where a dog is standing or where flies are swarming. He eats no fish or meat and drinks no rum or spirits or fermented rice-gruel.^f186
 He is a one-house man^f187 or a one-piece man,^f188 a two-house man, a seven-piece man or a seven-house man. 
 He exists on one, two or seven little offerings, eats only once a day, once in two days, once in seven days. 
He takes to eating rice only twice a month. 
^n395  These are considered proper practices.
 ‘Or a man becomes a herb-eater, a millet-eater, a raw-rice-eater, a wild-rice-eater, an eater of water-plants, of rice-husk-powder, of rice-scum, of the flowers of oil-seeds, grass or cow-dung, of forest roots and fruits, eating windfalls. 
^n396
He wears coarse hemp or mixed material, shrouds from corpses, rags from the dust-heap, garments of bark-fibre, antelope-skins, grass, bark, shavings, blankets of human hair^f189 or horse-hair, the wings of owls. 
He is a plucker-out of hair and beard, devoted to this practice;
 
he is a covered-thom man,
 making his bed on them,
 sleeping alone in a garment of wet mud,
 

living in the open air,
 accepting whatever seat is offered,
 living on filth and addicted to the practice,
 one who drinks no water^f190 and is addicted to the practice,
 or he dwells intent on the practice of going to bathe three times before evening.’^f191
^n397 ‘Kassapa, a practiser of self-mortification may do all these things,
 but if his morality, his heart and his wisdom are not developed and brought to realisation, then indeed he is still far from being an ascetic or a Brahmin. 
But, Kassapa, when a monk develops non-enmity, non-ill-will and a heart full of loving-kindness and, abandoning the corruptions, realises and dwells in the uncorrupted deliverance of mind, the deliverance through wisdom,
 having realised it in this very life by his own insight, then, Kassapa, that monk is termed an ascetic and a Brahmin.’^f192











^n398 At this Kassapa said to the Lord: 
‘Reverend Gotama, it is hard to be an ascetic, it is hard to be a Brahmin.’
‘So they say in the world, Kassapa: “It is hard to be an ascetic, it is hard to be a Brahmin.” 
If a naked ascetic were to do all these things... 
(^i[as verse 14]), and if this were the measure and practice of the difficulty, the great difficulty, of being an ascetic or Brahmin, it would not be right to say: 
“It is hard to be an ascetic, it is hard to be a Brahmin”
, because any householder or householder’s son — even the slave-girl who draws water — could do this saying: 
“Well, I will go naked...” (^i[as verse 14]). 
But, Kassapa, because there is a very different kind of asceticism beside this, therefore it is right to say: 
“It is hard to be an ascetic, it is hard to be a Brahmin.” 
But, Kassapa, when a monk develops non-enmity, non-ill-will and a heart full of loving kindness ... 
(^i[as verse 15]), then that monk is called an ascetic and a Brahmin.’ 


















^n399 At this Kassapa said to the Lord: 
‘Reverend Gotama, it is hard to understand an ascetic, it is hard to understand a Brahmin.’
‘So they say in the world, Kassapa: “It is hard to understand an ascetic, it is hard to understand a Brahmin.” 
If a naked ascetic were to do all these things,
 and if this were the measure and practice of the difficulty, the great difficulty, of understanding an ascetic or Brahmin, it would not be right to say that, because any householder...


could understand it. 
But, Kassapa, because there is a very different kind of asceticism and Brahmanism beside this, it is right to say: 
“It is hard to understand an ascetic or a Brahmin.” 
But, Kassapa, when a monk develops non-enmity, non-ill-will and a heart full of loving-kindness and, abandoning the corruptions, realises and dwells in the uncorrupted deliverance of mind, the deliverance through wisdom,
 having realised it in this very life by his own insight, then, Kassapa, that monk is called an ascetic and a Brahmin.’


















^n400 Then Kassapa said to the Lord:
 ‘Reverend Gotama, what then is the development of morality, of the heart, and of wisdom?’
 ‘Kassapa, a Tathāgata arises in the world an Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed. He, having realised it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world with its devas, māras and Brahmās, its princes and people. He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life. ^i[A disciple goes forth and practises the moralities] (^i[Sutta 2], ^i[verses 41 — 63]). That is the perfection of morality.
 ^i[He guards the sense-doors, etc. and attains the four jhānas] (^i[Sutta]2^i[verses 64 — 82]). That is the perfection of the heart. ^i[He attains various insights and the cessation of the corruptions] (^i[Sutta 2], ^i[verses 83 — 98]). 
^n401
























 That is the perfection of wisdom. 
And, Kassapa, there is nothing further or more perfect than this perfection of morality, of the heart and of wisdom.
^n402 ‘Kassapa, there are some ascetics and Brahmins who preach morality. 
They praise morality in various ways. 
But as regards the highest Ariyan morality, Kassapa, I do not see any who have surpassed me in this. 
I am supreme in this regard, in super-morality. 
There are some ascetics and Brahmins who preach self-mortification and scrupulous austerity,
 which they praise in various ways. 
But as regards the highest Ariyan self-mortification and austerity, Kassapa, I do not see any who have surpassed me in this. 
I am supreme in this regard, in super-austerity. 
There are some ascetics and Brahmins who preach wisdom. 
They praise wisdom in various ways. 
But as regards the highest Ariyan wisdom, Kassapa, I do not see any who have surpassed me in this. 
I am supreme in this regard, in super-wisdom.
 There are some ascetics and Brahmins who preach liberation. 
They praise liberation in various ways.
 But as regards the highest Ariyan liberation, Kassapa, I do not see any who have surpassed me in this. 
I am supreme in this regard, in super-liberation. 
^n403 ‘Kassapa, it may be that wanderers of other sects will say:
 “The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar, but only in empty places, not in company.”
 They should be told that this is not true:
 “The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar, and he roars it in company.”
 Or they may say:
 “The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar, and in company, but he does so without confidence.”
 They should be told that this is not true:
 “The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar, in company and confidently.”
 Or they may say:
 “The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar, and in company, and confidently, but they do not question him.” They should be told that this is not true: “The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar... and they question him.”
 Or they may say: “... and they question him, but he does not answer.” ...
 Or they may say: “ .. he answers, but he does not win them over with his answers.” ...
Or they may say: “... but they don’t find it pleasing.” ...
 Or they may say: “... but they are not satisfied with what they have heard.” ... 
Or they may say: “... but they don’t behave as if they were satisfied.” ...
 Or they may say: “... but they are not on the path of truth.” ... 
Or they may say: “... but they are not satisfied with the practice.” 
They should be told that this is not true:
 “The ascetic Gotama roars his lion’s roar, in company and confidently, they question him and he answers, he wins them over with his answers, they find it pleasing and are satisfied with what they have heard, they behave as if they were satisfied, they are on the path of truth, and they are satisfied with the practice.” That, Kassapa, is what they should be told.
^n404 ‘Once, Kassapa, I was staying at Rajagaha at the Vultures’ Peak. 
And a certain practiser of mortification called Nigrodha consulted me about the practice of austerity.^f193

 And he was delighted with my explanation beyond all measure.’ 
‘Lord, who on hearing Dhamma from you would fail to be delighted beyond all measure? 
I am delighted beyond all measure. 
Excellent, Lord, excellent! 
It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there. 
Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways. 
Lord, may I receive the going-forth at the Lord’s hands, may I receive ordination!’
^n405 ‘Kassapa, whoever has formerly belonged to another sect and wishes for the going-forth or ordination in this Dhamma and discipline must wait four months, and at the end of four months’ probation, the monks who are established in mind will give him the going-forth and the monastic ordination.
 But there can be a distinction of persons in this.’ 
‘Lord, if such is the case, I will even wait four years, and at the end of that time let the monks give me the going-forth and the monastic ordination.’
Then Kassapa received the going- -forth from the Lord himself, and the monastic ordination. 
And the newly-ordained Venerable Kassapa, alone, secluded, unwearying, zealous and resolute, in a short time attained that for which young men of good birth go forth from the household life into homelessness, that unexcelled culmination of the holy life, having realised it here and now by his own super-knowledge and dwelt therein knowing: 
‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further here.’
 And the Venerable Kassapa became another of the Arahants.

^ck#d9(^z1[Poṭṭhapāda Sutta: About Poṭṭhapāda] ^h[States of Consciousness] )^n406 THUS HAVE I HEARD.
 Once the Lord was staying at Savatthi, in Jeta’s grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika’s park. 
And at that time the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda was at the debating-hall near the Tinduka tree, in the single-halled park of Queen Mallikā,^f194 with a large crowd of about three hundred wanderers.
 Then the Lord, rising early, took his robe and bowl and went to Sāvatthi for alms.
^n407 But it occurred to him:
 ‘It is too early to go to Sāvatthi for alms. 
Suppose I were to go to the debating-hall to see the wanderer Poṭṭhapāda?’ 
And he did so.
^n408 There Poṭṭhapāda was sitting with his crowd of wanderers, all shouting and making a great commotion, indulging in various kinds of unedifying conversation,
 such as about kings, robbers, ministers, armies, dangers, wars, food, drink, clothes, beds, garlands, perfumes, relatives, carriages, villages, towns and cities, countries, women, heroes, street- and well-gossip, talk of the departed, desultory chat, speculations about land and sea, talk of being and non-being.
^n409 But Poṭṭhapāda saw the Lord coming from a distance,
 and so he called his followers to order, saying: 
‘Be quiet, gentlemen, don’t make a noise, gentlemen! 
That ascetic Gotama is coming,
 and he likes quiet and speaks in praise of quiet. 
If he sees that this company is quiet, he will most likely want to come and visit us.’ 
At this the wanderers fell silent.
^n410 Then the Lord came to Poṭṭhapāda,
 who said: 
‘Come, reverend Lord,
 welcome, reverend Lord! 
At last the reverend Lord has gone out of his way to come here. 
Be seated, Lord, a seat is prepared.’
The Lord sat down on the prepared seat,
 and Potthapada took a low stool and sat down to one side. 
The Lord said:
 ‘Poṭṭhapāda, what were you all talking about? What conversation have I interrupted?’
^n411 Poṭṭhapāda replied: 
‘Lord, never mind the conversation we were having just now,
 it will not be difficult for the Lord to hear about that later. 
In the past few days, Lord, the discussion among the ascetics and Brahmins of various schools, sitting together and meeting in the debating-hall, has concerned the higher extinction of consciousness,^f195
 and how this takes place.
 Some said: 
“One’s perceptions arise and cease without cause or condition. 
When they arise, one is conscious,
 when they cease, then one is unconscious.” 
That is how they explained it. 
But somebody else said: 
“No, that is not how it is. 
Perceptions^f196 are a person’s self,
 which comes and goes. 
When it comes, one is conscious,
 when it goes, one is unconscious.” 

Another said: 
“That is not how it is. 
There are ascetics and Brahmins of great powers, of great influence. 
They draw down consciousness into a man and withdraw it. 
When they draw it down into him, he is conscious,
 when they withdraw it, he is unconscious.”^f197

 And another said: 
“No, that is not how it is. 
There are deities of great powers, of great influence. 
They draw down consciousness into a man and withdraw it. 
When they draw it down into him, he is conscious,
 when they withdraw it, he is unconscious.”^f198

 It was in this connection that I thought of the Lord: 
“Ah, surely, the Blessed Lord, the Well-Farer, he is supremely skilled^f199 about these matters! 
The Blessed Lord well understands the higher extinction of consciousness.” 
What then, Lord, is this higher extinction of consciousness?’
^n412 ‘In this matter, Poṭṭhapāda, those ascetics and Brahmins who say
 one’s perceptions arise and cease without cause or condition are totally wrong.
 Why is that?
 One’s perceptions arise and cease owing to a cause and conditions.
 Some perceptions arise through training, and some pass away through training.’
^n413 ‘What is this training?’, the Lord said. 
‘Potṭhapāda, a Tathāgata arises in this world an Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed. He, having realised it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world with its devas, māras and Brahmās, its princes and people. He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life. 
 ^i[A disciple goes forth and practises the moralities (Sutta 2, verses 41 — 62]). That for him is morality.‘And then, Poṭṭhapāda, that monk who is perfected in morality sees no danger from any side... (^i[as Sutta]2^i[, verse 63]). In this way he is perfected in morality. 
^i[He guards the sense-doors, etc.] (^i[Sutta 2, verses 64 — 75]).
 Having reached the first jhāna, he remains in it.
 And whatever sensations of lust that he previously had disappear.
 At that time there is present a true but subtle perception of delight and happiness,^f200 born of detachment, and he becomes one who is conscious of this delight and happiness. 
In this way some perceptions arise through training, and some pass away through training. 
And this is that training’, said the Lord.
‘Again, a monk, with the subsiding of thinking and pondering, by gaining inner tranquillity and unity of mind, reaches and remains in the second jhāna, which is free from thinking and pondering, born of concentration, filled with delight and happiness. 
His former true but subtle perception of delight and happiness born of detachment vanishes. 
At that time there arises a true but subtle perception of delight and happiness born of concentration, and he becomes one who is conscious of this delight and happiness. 
In this way some perceptions arise through training, and some pass away through training.

‘Again, after the fading away of delight he dwells in equanimity, mindful and clearly aware, and he experiences in his body that pleasant feeling of which the Noble Ones say: “Happy dwells the man of equanimity and mindfulness”, and he reaches and remains in the third jhāna. 
His former true but subtle sense of delight and happiness born of concentration vanishes, and there arises at that time a true but subtle sense of equanimity and happiness,
 and he becomes one who is conscious of this true but subtle sense of equanimity and happiness. 
In this way some perceptions arise through training, and some pass away through training.

‘Again, with the abandonment of pleasure and pain, and with the disappearance of previous joy and grief, he reaches and remains in the fourth jhana, a state beyond pleasure and pain, purified by equanimity and mindfulness. 
His former true but subtle sense of equanimity and happiness vanishes,
 and there arises a true but subtle sense of neither happiness nor unhappiness, and he becomes one who is conscious of this true but subtle sense of neither happiness nor unhappiness. 
In this way some perceptions arise through training, and some pass away through training.

‘Again, by passing entirely beyond bodily sensations, by the disappearance of all sense of resistance and by non-attraction to the perception of diversity, seeing that space is infinite, he reaches and remains in the Sphere of Infinite Space. 
In this way some perceptions arise through training, and some pass away through training.
‘Again, by passing entirely beyond the Sphere of Infinite Space, seeing that consciousness is infinite, he reaches and remains in the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness. 
In this way some perceptions arise through training, and some pass away through training.

‘Again, by passing entirely beyond the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness, seeing that there is no thing, he reaches and remains in the Sphere of No-Thingness, and he becomes one who is conscious of this true but subtle perception of the Sphere of No-Thingness. 
In this way some perceptions arise through training, and some pass away through training. 
And this is that training’, said the Lord.







^n414 ‘Potthapada, from the moment when a monk has gained this controlled perception,^f201 he proceeds from stage to stage till he reaches the limit of perception.
 When he has reached the limit of perception it occurs to him: 
“Mental activity is worse for me, lack of mental activity is better. 
If I were to think and imagine,^f202 these perceptions 〔that I have attained〕 would cease, and coarser perceptions would arise in me. 
Suppose I were not to think or imagine?” 
So he neither thinks nor imagines. 
And then, in him, just these perceptions arise, but other, coarser perceptions do not arise. 
He attains cessation. 
And that, Poṭṭhapāda, is the way in which the cessation of perception is brought about by successive steps.
‘What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? 
Have you heard of this before?’ 
‘No, Lord. 
As I understand it, the Lord has said: 
“Poṭṭhapāda, from the moment when a monk has gained this controlled perception, he proceeds from stage to stage until he reaches the limit of perception... 





He attains cessation ... 
and that is the way in which the cessation of perception is brought about by successive steps.”’ 
‘That is right, Poṭṭhapāda.’
^n415 ‘Lord, do you teach that the summit of perception is just one, or that it is many?’
 ‘I teach it as both one and many.’ 
‘Lord, how is it one, and how is it many?’ 
‘According as he attains successively to the cessation of each perception, so I teach the summit of that perception: 
thus I teach both one summit of perception, and I also teach many.’
^n416 ‘Lord, does perception arise before knowledge, or knowledge arise before perception, or do both arise simultaneously? 
’ ‘Perception arises first, Poṭṭhapāda, then knowledge, and from the arising of perception comes the arising of knowledge. 
And one knows: 
“Thus conditioned, knowledge arises.” 
In this way you can see how
 perception arises first, and then knowledge, and that from the arising of perception comes the arising of knowledge.’^f203
^n417 ‘Lord, is perception a person’s self, or is perception one thing, and self another?’^f204 
‘Well, Poṭṭhapāda, do you postulate ^f205 a self?’ 
‘Lord, I postulate a gross self, material, composed of the four elements, and feeding on solid food.’ 
‘But with such a gross self, Poṭṭhapāda, perception would be one thing, and the self another. 
You can see that in this way. 
Given such a gross self, certain perceptions would arise in a person, and others pass away. 
In this way you can see that perception must be one thing, the self another.’^f206
^n418 ‘Lord, I postulate a mind-made self complete with all its parts, not defective in any sense-organ.’^f207
 ‘But with such a mind-made self, perception would be one thing, and the self another...’ 



^n419 ‘Lord, I assume a formless self, made up of perception. ’^f208
 ‘But with such a formless self, perception would be one thing, and self another...’



^n420 ‘But Lord, is it possible for me to know whether
 perception is a person’s self, or whether perception is one thing, and self another?’ 
‘Poṭṭhāpada, it is difficult for one of different views, a different faith, under different influences, with different pursuits and a different training to know whether these are two different things or not.’

‘Well, Lord, if this question of self and perceptions is difficult for one like me —
 tell me:
 Is the world eternal?^f209 Is only this true and the opposite false?’
 ‘Poṭṭhapāda, I have not declared that the world is eternal and that the opposite view is false.’ 
‘Well, Lord, is the world not eternal?’
 
‘I have not declared that the world is not eternal...’ 

‘Well, Lord, is the world infinite,... not infinite?...’ 
‘I have not declared that the world is not infinite and that the opposite view is false.’
‘Well, Lord, is the soul the same as the body, ... is the soul one thing and the body another?’ 
‘I have not declared that the soul is one thing and the body another.’
‘Well, Lord, does the Tathāgata exist after death? Is only this true and all else false?’ ‘I have not declared that the Tathāgata exists after death.’ 
‘Well, Lord, does the Tathāgata not exist after death,...
both exist and not exist after death? ... 
neither exist nor not exist after death?’
 ‘I have not declared that the Tathāgata neither exists nor does not exist after death, and that all else is false.’

‘But, Lord, why has the Lord not declared these things?’
 ‘Poṭṭhāpada, that is not conducive to the purpose, not conducive to Dhamma, not the way to embark on the holy life; it does not lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to higher knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna. 
That is why I have not declared it.’
‘But, Lord, what has the Lord declared?’
 ‘Poṭṭhapāda, I have declared: “This is suffering, this is the origin of suffering, this is the cessation of suffering, and this is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.”’
‘But, Lord, why has the Lord declared this?’
 ‘Because, Poṭṭhapāda, this is conducive to the purpose, conducive to Dhamma, the way to embark on the holy life; it leads to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to higher knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.
 That is why I have declared it.’
‘So it is, Lord, so it is, Well-Farer. 
And now is the time for the Blessed Lord to do as he sees fit.’ 
Then the Lord rose from his seat and went away.
^n421 Then the wanderers, as soon as the Lord had left, reproached, sneered and jeered at Poṭṭhapāda from all sides, saying:
 ‘Whatever the ascetic Gotama says, Poṭṭhapāda agrees with him:
 “So it is, Lord, so it is, Well-Farer!” ^i[We] don’t understand a word of the ascetic Gotama’s whole discourse: “Is the world eternal or not? 
— Is it finite or infinite? — Is the soul the same as the body or different? — Does the Tathāgata exist after death or not, or both, or neither?”’

Poṭṭhapāda replied: 
‘I don’t understand either about whether the world is eternal or not...
or whether the Tathāgata exists after death or not, or both, or neither. 

But the ascetic Gotama teaches a true and real way of practice which is consonant with Dhamma and grounded in Dhamma. 
And why should not a man like me express approval of such a true and real practice, so well taught by the ascetic Gotama?’
^n422 Two or three days later, Citta, the son of the elephant-trainer, went with Poṭṭhāpada to see the Lord.
 Citta prostrated himself before the Lord and sat down to one side. 
Potthapada exchanged courtesies with the Lord, sat down to one side, and told him what had happened. 











^n423 ‘Poṭṭhapāda, all those wanderers are blind and sightless, you alone among them are sighted. 
Some things I have taught and pointed out, Poṭṭhāpada, as being certain, others as being uncertain. 
Which are the things I have pointed out as uncertain? 


“The world is eternal” I have declared to be uncertain... 





“The Tathāgata exists after death ...” 



Why?
 Because they are not conducive... to Nibbāna. 
That is why I have declared them as uncertain.‘
^n424 But what things have I pointed out as certain? 
“This is suffering, this is the origin of suffering, this is the cessation of suffering, this is the path leading to the cessation of suffering.”



 Why? 
Because they are conducive to the purpose, conducive to Dhamma, the way to embark on the holy life; they lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to calm, to higher knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbana. 
That is why I have declared them as certain.
^n425 ‘Poṭṭhapāda, there are some ascetics and Brahmins
 who declare and believe that after death the self is entirely happy and free from disease. 
I approached them and asked
 if this was indeed what they declared and believed,
 and they replied: 
“Yes.” 
Then I said:
 “Do you, friends, living in the world, know and see it as an entirely happy place?” 
and they replied: “No.” 
I said: 
“Have you ever experienced a single night or day, or half a night or day, that was entirely happy?” 
and they replied: “No.” 
I said: 
“Do you know
 a path or a practice whereby an entirely happy world might be brought about?” 
and they replied: “No.” 
I said: 
“Have you heard the voices of deities who have been reborn in an entirely happy world, saying: 
‘The attainment of an entirely happy world has been well and rightly gained,
 and we, gentlemen, have been reborn in such a realm’?” 
and they replied: “No.” 
What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? 
Such being the case, does not the talk of those ascetics and Brahmins turn out to be stupid?

^n426 ‘It is just as if a man were to say:
 “1 am going to seek out and love the most beautiful girl in the country.”
 They might say to him:
 “Well, as to this most beautiful girl in the country, do you know whether she belongs to the Khattiya, the Brahmin, the merchant or the artisan class?” 
and he would say: “No.” 
Then they might say: 
“Well, do you know her name, her clan, whether she is tall or short or of medium height, whether she is dark or light-complexioned or sallow-skinned, or what village or town or city she comes from?” 
and he would say: “No.” 
And they might say: 
“Well then, you don’t know or see the one you seek for and desire?” 
and he would say: “No.” 

Does not the talk of that man turn out to be stupid?’ 
‘Certainly, Lord.’
‘And so it is with those ascetics and Brahmins who declare and believe that after death the self is entirely happy and free from disease... 
Does not their talk turn out to be stupid?’ 
‘Certainly, Lord.’




















^n427 ‘It is just as if a man were to build a staircase for a palace at a crossroads.
 People might say to him:
 “Well now, this staircase for a palace that you are building — do you know whether the palace will face east, or west, or north or south, or whether it will be high, low or of medium height?” 
and he would say: “No.” 
And they might say: 
“Well then, you don’t know or see what kind of a palace you are building the staircase for?” 
and he would say: “No.” 

Don’t you think that man’s talk would turn out to be stupid?’ 
‘Certainly, Lord.’
(^i[as verse] 34)  





















^n428 ‘Poṭṭhapāda, there are three kinds of “acquired self”:^f210
 the gross acquired self, the mind-made acquired self, the formless acquired self. 
What is the gross acquired self? 
It has form, is composed of the four great elements, nourished by material food. 
What is the mind-made self? 
It has form, complete with all its parts, not defective in any sense-organ. 
What is the formless acquired self? 
It is without form, and made up of perception.
^n429 ‘But I teach a doctrine for getting rid of the gross acquired self,
 whereby defiling mental states disappear and states tending to purification grow strong, and one gains and remains in the purity and perfection of wisdom here and now, having realised and attained it by one’s own super-knowledge.
 Now, Poṭṭhāpada, you might think:
 “Perhaps these defiling mental states might disappear..., and one might still be unhappy.”^f211
 That is not how it should be regarded. 
If defiling states disappear..., nothing but happiness and delight develops, tranquillity, mindfulness and clear awareness — and that is a happy state.
^n430 ‘I also teach a doctrine for getting rid of the mind-made acquired self...
(^i[as verse] 40).




^n431 ‘I also teach a doctrine for getting rid of the formless acquired self...
(^i[as verse 40]). 




^n432 ‘Poṭṭhapāda, if others ask us:
 “What, friend, is this gross acquired self whose abandonment you preach ... ?” being so asked, we should reply: 
“This ^i[is]^f212 that gross acquired self for the getting rid of which we teach a doctrine...”
^n433 ‘If others ask us: 
“What is this mind-made acquired self ...?” 
(^i[as verse 43]). 

^n434 ‘If others ask us: 
“What is this formless acquired self ...?” 
(^i[as verse 43]). 

What do you think, Poṭṭhapāda? 
Does not that statement turn out to be well-founded?’ 
‘Certainly, Lord.’
^n435 ‘It is just as if a man were to build a staircase for a palace, which was below that palace. 
They might say to him: 
“Well now, this staircase for a palace that you are building, do you know whether the palace will face east or west, or north or south, or whether it will be high, low or of medium height?” 
and he would say: 
“This staircase is right under the palace.” 
Don’t you think that
 man’s statement would be well-founded?’ 
‘Certainly, Lord.’ 
^n436 ‘In just the same way, Poṭṭhapāda, if others ask us:
 “What is this gross acquired self...?” “What is this mind-made acquired self...?” 
“What is this formless acquired self ... ?” 
we reply: 
“This is this 〔gross, mind-made, formless〕 acquired self for the getting rid of which we teach a doctrine, whereby defiling mental states disappear and states tending to purification grow strong, and one gains and remains in the purity and perfection of wisdom here and now, having realised and attained it by one’s own super-knowledge.” 
Don’t you think that
 statement is well-founded?’ 
‘Certainly, Lord.’
^n437 At this, Citta, son of the elephant-trainer, said to the Lord: 
‘Lord, whenever the gross acquired self is present,
 would it be wrong to assume the existence of the mind-made acquired self,
 or of the formless acquired self? 
Does only the gross acquired self truly exist then? 
And similarly with the mind-made acquired self, and the formless acquired self?’
‘Citta, whenever the gross acquired self is present,
 we do not at that time speak of a mind-made acquired self, we do not speak of a formless acquired self. 
We speak only of a gross acquired self.^f213
 Whenever the mind-made acquired self is present,
 we speak only of a mind-made acquired self,
 and whenever the formless acquired self is present,
 we speak only of a formless acquired self.
^n438 ‘Citta, suppose they were to ask you: 
“Did you exist in the past or didn’t you,
 will you exist in the future or won’t you,
 do you exist now or don’t you?” 
how would you answer?’
‘Lord, if I were asked such a question,
 I would say: 
“I did exist in the past,
 I did not not exist;
 I shall exist in the future,
 I shall not not exist;
 I do exist now,
 I do not not exist.” 
That, Lord, would be my answer.’
‘But, Citta, if they asked: 
“The past acquired self that you had, is that your only true acquired self, and are the future and present ones false? 
Or is the one you will have in the future the only true one, and are the past and present ones false? 
Or is your present acquired self the only true one, and are the past and future ones false?” 
how would you reply?’
‘Lord, if they asked me these things, I would reply: 
“My past acquired self was at the time my only true one, the future and present ones were false. 
My future acquired self will then be the only true one, the past and present ones will be false. 
My present acquired self is now the only true one, the past and future ones are false.” 
That is how I would reply.’




^n439 ‘In just the same way, Citta, whenever the gross acquired self is present, we do not at that time speak of a mind-made acquired self... 
〔or〕 of a formless acquired self.



^n440 ‘In just the same way, Citta, from the cow we get milk, from the milk curds, from the curds butter, from the butter ghee, and from the ghee cream of ghee. 
And when there is milk we don’t speak of curds, of butter, of ghee or of cream of ghee,
 we speak of milk;
 when there are curds we don’t speak of butter...;
 when there is cream of ghee... 
we speak of cream of ghee. 


‘So too, whenever the gross acquired self is present, we do not speak of the mind-made or formless acquired self;
 whenever the mind-made acquired self is present, we do not speak of the gross or formless acquired self;
 whenever the formless acquired self is present, we do not speak of the gross acquired self or the mind-made acquired self, we speak of the formless acquired self. 

But, Citta, these are merely names, expressions, turns of speech, designations in common use in the world, which the Tathāgata uses without misapprehending them.’^f214
^n441 And at these words Poṭṭhapāda the wanderer said to the Lord:
 ‘Excellent, Lord, excellent!
 It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there. Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways. 
Lord, I go for refuge to the Lord, the Dhamma and the Sangha. 
May the Lord accept me as a lay-follower who has taken refuge in him from this day forth as long as life shall last!’
^n442 But Citta, son of the elephant-trainer, said to the Lord:
 ‘Excellent, Lord, excellent!
 It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there. Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways. 
Lord, I go for refuge to the Lord, the Dhamma and the Sangha. 
May I, Lord, receive the going-forth at the Lord’s hands, may I receive ordination!’
^n443 And Citta, son of the elephant-trainer, received the going-forth at the Lord’s hands, and the ordination. 
And the newly-ordained Venerable Citta, alone, secluded, unwearying, zealous and resolute, in a short time attained to that for the sake of which young men of good birth go forth from the household life into homelessness, that unexcelled culmination of the holy life, having realised it here and now by his own super-knowledge and dwelt therein, knowing: 
‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further here.’
 And the Venerable Citta, son of the elephant-trainer, became another of the Arahants.

^ck#d10(^z1[Subha Sutta: About Subha] ^h[Morality, Concentration, Wisdom] )^n444 THUS HAVE I HEARD.^f215
 Once the Venerable Ananda was staying at Savatthi, in Jeta’s grove, in Anāthapiṇḍika’s park, shortly after the Lord’s final passing.^f216
 And at that time the youth Subha, Todeyya’s son,^f217 was staying at Savatthi on some business.
^n445 And Subha said to a certain young man: 
‘Go, my lad, to where the ascetic Ananda is, ask him in my name if he is in good health, free from fatigue, strong, vigorous and dwelling in comfort, and say: 
“It would be good if the Reverend Ananda would, out of compassion, visit the dwelling of Subha the son of Todeyya.”’

‘Very good, sir’, replied the young man. 
^n446 Then he went to the Venerable Ananda, exchanged courtesies with him, and sat down to one side. 
Then he delivered the message.



^n447 The Venerable Ananda replied: 
‘It is not the right time, young man. 
Today I have taken some medicine. 
Perhaps it will be possible to come tomorrow when the time and the occasion are suitable.’ 
And the young man rose, returned to Subha and reported what had passed between him and the Venerable Ananda, adding: 







‘My mission has been thus far accomplished, that the Reverend Ananda will probably take the opportunity to come tomorrow.’
^n448 And indeed, as that night was ending, the Venerable Ananda dressed in the early morning, took his robe and bowl and, accompanied by the Venerable Cetaka,^f218 came to Subha’s dwelling, and sat down on the prepared seat.
 Then Subha approached the Venerable Ananda, exchanged courtesies with him,
 and sat down to one side. Then he said:
‘The Reverend Ananda was for a long time the Reverend Gotama’s personal attendant, dwelling in his presence and near him. 
You, Reverend Ananda, would know what things the Reverend Gotama praised, and with which he aroused, exhorted and established people. 
Which, Reverend Ananda, were those things?’
^n449 ‘Subha, there were three divisions of things which the Lord praised, and with which he aroused, exhorted and established people.
 Which three? 
The division of Ariyan morality,^f219 the division of Ariyan concentration, and the division of Ariyan wisdom. 
These were the three divisions of things which the Lord praised...’
^n450 ?’ ‘Young sir, a Tathāgata arises in the world, an Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed.
 He, having realised it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world with its devas, māras and Brahmās, its princes and people. He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life.

 Thus a monk is perfected in morality.

 But something more remains to be done.’
 ‘It is wonderful, Reverend Ananda, it is marvellous!
 This division of Ariyan morality is perfectly fulfilled, not left incomplete. 
And I do not see this division of Ariyan morality fulfilled thus anywhere among the ascetics and Brahmins of other schools.
 And if any of them were to have found this perfection in themselves, they would have been so delighted that they would have said:

^ck#d11(^z1[Kevaddha Sutta: About Kevaddha] ^h[What Brahma Didn’t Know] )^n481 THUS HAVE I HEARD.
 Once the Lord was staying at Nālanda, in Pāvārika’s mango grove.
 And the householder Kevaddha ^f220 came to the Lord, prostrated himself before him, and sat down to one side. He then said: 
‘Lord, this Nāḷandā is rich, prosperous, populous, and full of people who have faith in the Lord. 
It would be well if the Lord were to cause some monk to perform superhuman feats and miracles. 
In this way Nāḷandā would come to have even more faith in the Lord.’
The Lord replied: 
‘Kevaddha, this is not the way I teach Dhamma to the monks, by saying: 
“Go, monks, and perform superhuman feats and miracles for the white-clothed lay-people! ’ 
^n482 For a second time Kevaddha said: 
‘Lord, I would not be importunate,
 but I still say: 
“This Nalanda is rich, prosperous ... 

and would come to have even more faith in the Lord.”’ 
And the Lord replied as before.


When Kevaddha repeated his request for a third time, the Lord said: 
‘Kevaddha, there are three kinds of miracle that I have declared, having realised them by my own insight. 
Which three? 
The miracle of psychic power,^f221 the miracle of telepathy,^f222 the miracle of instruction.^f223


^n483 


^n484 ‘What is the miracle of psychic power? 
Here, Kevaddha, a monk displays various psychic powers in different ways. Being one he becomes many, being many he becomes one... (^i[as Sutta 2, verse 87]) and he travels in the body as far as the Brahma world. 
Then someone who has faith and trust sees him doing these things.
‘He tells this to someone else who is sceptical and unbelieving, saying:
 “It is wonderful, sir, it is marvellous, the great power and skill of that ascetic ...”
 
And that man might say: 
“Sir, there is something called the Gandhāra charm.^f224
 It is by means of this that that monk becomes many...” 
What do you think, Kevaddha,
 would not a sceptic say that to a believer?’ 
‘He would, Lord.’ 
‘And that is why, Kevaddha, seeing the danger of such miracles, I dislike, reject and despise them.
^n485 ‘And what is the miracle of telepathy? 
Here, a monk reads the minds of other beings, of other people, reads their mental states, their thoughts and ponderings, and says: 
“That is how your mind is, that is how it inclines, that is in your heart.” 
Then someone who has faith and trust sees him doing these things.

‘He tells this to someone else who is sceptical and unbelieving, saying: 
“It is wonderful, sir, it is marvellous, the great power and skill of that ascetic ...” 


And that man might say: 
“Sir, there is something called the Manika charm.^f225
 It is by means of this that that monk can read the minds of others ...” 
And that is why, seeing the danger of such miracles, I... 



despise them.
^n486 ‘And what is the miracle of instruction?
 Here, Kevaddha, a monk gives instruction as follows: 
“Consider in this way, don’t consider in that, direct your mind this way, not that way, give up that, gain this and persevere in it.” 
That, Kevaddha, is called the miracle of instruction.
‘Again, Kevaddha, a Tathāgata arises in the world, an Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed. 
He, having realised it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world with its devas, māras and Brahmās, its princes and people. 
He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life.

“...




There is nothing further here.” 
That, Kevaddha, is called the miracle of instruction.
‘And I, Kevaddha, have experienced these three miracles by my own super-knowledge. Once, Kevaddha, in this order of monks the thought occurred to a certain monk: 
^n487 And that monk attained to such a state of mental concentration that the way to the deva-realms appeared before him.

^n488 ‘Then, coming to the Realm of the devas of the Four Great Kings,^f227
 he asked those devas: 
“Friends, where do the four great elements -- earth, water, fire and air — cease without remainder?” 
At this question the devas of the Four Great Kings said to him: 
“Monk, we don’t know where
 the four great elements cease without remainder. 
But the Four Great Kings are loftier and wiser than we are. 
They may know where the four great elements cease ... ” 

^n489 ‘So that monk went to the Four Great Kings and asked the same question,

 but they replied: 
“We don’t know,

 but the Thirty-Three Gods may know...”


^n490 ‘So that monk went to the Thirty-Three Gods,

 who said: 
“We don’t know,

 but Sakka, lord of the gods, may know...” 


^n491 ‘Sakka, lord of the gods,

 said: 


“The Yāma devas may know ... ” 
‘The Yama devas said: “Suyāma, son of the devas,^f228 may know ... ” 
‘Suyama said: “The Tusita devas may know...” 
‘The Tusita devas said: “Santusita, son of the devas, may know...” 
‘Santusita said: “The Nimmanarati devas may know...” 
‘The Nimmanarati devas said: “Sunimmita, son of the devas, may know...” 
‘Sunimitta said: “The Paranimmita-Vasavatti devas may know...”
‘The Paranimmita-Vasavatti devas said: 
“Vasavatti, son of the devas, may know...”

^n492 ‘Vasavatti said: 




“The devas of Brahmā’s retinue
 may know ... ” 

^n493 ‘Then that monk, by the appropriate concentration, made the way to the Brahmā world appear before him. 
He went to the devas of Brahmā’s retinue and asked them. 

They said: 
“We don’t know. 

But there is Brahmā, Great Brahmā, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Lord, the Maker and Creator, the Ruler, Appointer and Orderer, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be. He is loftier and wiser than we are. 
He would know where the four great elements cease without remainder.” 

“And where, friends, is this Great Brahmā now?” 
“Monk, we do not know when, how and where Brahmā will appear. 
But when the signs are seen — when a light appears and a radiance shines forth — then Brahmā will appear. Such signs are an indication that he will appear.”
‘Then it was not long before the Great Brahmā appeared.
^n494 And that monk went up to him and said: 
 “Friend, where do the four great elements — earth, water, fire, air — cease without remainder?” 
to which the Great Brahmā replied: 
“Monk, I am Brahmā, Great Brahmā, the Conqueror, the Unconquered, the All-Seeing, All-Powerful, the Lord, the Maker and Creator, the Ruler, Appointer and Orderer, Father of All That Have Been and Shall Be.”
‘A second time the monk said: 
“Friend, I did not ask if you are Brahmā, Great Brahmā ... 

I asked you
 where the four great elements cease without remainder.” 
And a second time the Great Brahmā replied as before.

‘And a third time the monk said: 
“Friend, I did not ask you that,
 I asked where the four great elements — earth, water, fire, air — cease without remainder.” Then, Kevaddha, the Great Brahmā took that monk by the arm, led him aside and said: 
“Monk, these devas believe there is nothing Brahmā does not see, there is nothing he does not know, there is nothing he is unaware of. 
That is why I did not speak in front of them. 
^n495 But, monk, I don’t know where the four great elements cease without remainder. 



And therefore, monk, you have acted wrongly, you have acted incorrectly by going beyond the Blessed Lord and going in search of an answer to this question elsewhere. 
Now, monk, you just go to the Blessed Lord and put this question to him, and whatever answer he gives, accept it.”
^n496 ‘So that monk, as swiftly as a strong man might flex or unflex his arm, vanished from the Brahma world and appeared in my presence.
 He prostrated himself before me, then sat down to one side and said: 
“Lord, where do the four great elements — the earth element, the water element, the fire element and the air element - cease without remainder?”
^n497 ‘I replied: 
“Monk, once upon a time seafaring merchants, when they set sail on the ocean, took in their ship a land-sighting bird. 
When they could not see the land themselves, they released this bird. 
The bird flew to the east, to the south, to the west, to the north, it flew to the zenith and to the intermediate points of the compass. 
If it saw land anywhere, it flew there. 
But if it saw no land, it returned to the ship. 
In the same way, monk, you have been as far as the Brahma world searching for an answer to your question and not finding it, and now you come back to me. 
But, monk, you should not ask your question in this way: 
‘Where do the four great elements — the earth element, the water element, the fire element, the air element — cease without remainder?’ 
^n498 Instead, this is how the question should have been put:
‘Where do earth, water,
 fire and air no footing find?
Where are long and short,
 small and great, fair and foul - 
Where are “name-and-form” 
wholly destroyed?’^f229
^n499  And the answer is:
‘Where consciousness is
 signless,^f230 boundless, all-luminous, ^f231 
That’s where earth, water,
 fire and air find no footing, 
^i[There] both long and short,
 small and great, fair and foul - 
There “name-and-form” 
are wholly destroyed.
With the cessation of consciousness
 this is all destroyed.”” ^f232
^n500  Thus the Lord spoke,
 and the householder Kevaddha, delighted, rejoiced at his words.

^ck#d12(^z1[Lohicca Sutta: About Lohicca] ^h[Good and Bad Teachers] )^n501 THUS HAVE I HEARD.
 Once the Lord was touring Kosala with a large company of some five hundred monks, and, coming to Sālavatikā, he stayed there. 
And at that time the Brahmin Lohicca was living at Sālavatikā, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water and corn, which had been given to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala as a royal gift and with royal powers.
^n502 Just then this evil line of reasoning occurred to Lohicca:
 ‘Suppose an ascetic or Brahmin were to discover some good doctrine?^f233 having done so, he ought not to declare it to anyone else; for what can one man do for another? 
It is just as if a man, having cut through an old fetter, were to make a new one. 
I declare that such a thing is an evil deed rooted in attachment, for what can one man do for another?’
^n503 Then Lohicca heard it said that
 the ascetic Gotama had arrived at Salavatika, and that concerning the Blessed Lord Gotama a good report had been spread about... 
(^i[as Sutta 4, verse] 2). 



‘And indeed it is good to see such Arahants.’
^n504 And Lohicca said to Bhesika the barber: 
‘Friend Bhesika, go to the ascetic Gotama, ask in my name after his health and then say: 
“May the Reverend Gotama consent to take tomorrow’s meal, with his order of monks, from the Brahmin Lohicca!’”


^n505 ‘Very good, sir’, said Bhesika, and carried out the errand. 



The Lord signified his acceptance by silence.
^n506 Then Bhesika, understanding the Lord’s acceptance, rose from his seat and passed by with his right side to the Lord. 




He returned to Lohicca and told him of the Lord’s acceptance.
^n507 And Lohicca, as the night was ending, had choice hard and soft foods prepared at his own home. 
Then he sent Bhesika to tell the Lord that
 the meal was ready. 



^n508 And the Lord, having risen early and taken his robe and bowl, went with his order of monks to Sālavatikā.
And Bhesika the barber followed the Lord close at hand. 
And he said: 
‘Lord, this evil thought has occurred to the Brahmin Lohicca...
Truly, Lord, this is what the Brahmin Lohicca has been thinking.’ 
‘It may well be so, Bhesika, it may well be so.’





So the Lord came to Lohicca’s dwelling, and sat down on the prepared seat. 
Lohicca personally served the Buddha and his order of monks with choice hard and soft food till they were contented and satisfied. 
^n509
 Then the Lord said to him: 
‘Lohicca, is it true that an evil line of reasoning has occurred to you ... 
(as ^i[verse 2)?]
’ ‘Yes, Reverend Gotama.’


‘What do you think, Lohicca?
 Don’t you reside at Sālavatikā? ’
 ‘Yes, Reverend Gotama.’ 
‘Well now, if anyone should say: 
“The Brahmin Lohicca resides at Sālavatikā,
 and he should enjoy the entire fruits and revenues of Sālavatikā, not giving anything away to others” 
— would not anyone who spoke like that be a source of danger to your tenants?’ 
‘He would be a source of danger, Reverend Gotama.’
‘And as such, would he be solicitous for their welfare or not?’ 
‘He would not, Reverend Gotama.’
‘And, by not being solicitous for their welfare, would he have a heart full of love for them, or of hatred?’ 
‘Of hatred, Reverend Gotama.’
‘And in a heart full of hatred, is there wrong view or right view?’ 
‘Wrong view, Reverend Gotama,’  
‘But Lohicca, I declare that wrong view leads to one of two destinies —
 hell or an animal rebirth.^f234
^n510 ‘What do you think, Lohicca? 
Does King Pasenadi of Kosala reside at Kāsi-Kosala?’ 
‘He does, Reverend Gotama.’ 
‘Well, if anyone should say: 
“King Pasenadi of Kosala resides at Kāsi-Kosala,
 and he should enjoy the entire fruits and revenues of Kosala, not giving anything away to others” 
— would not anyone who spoke like that be a source of danger to his tenants? ... 



Would he not have a heart full of hatred ... 

and would that not be wrong view?’ 
‘It would, Reverend Gotama.’


^n511 ‘Then surely, if anyone were to say the same of the Brahmin Lohicca ... 



that would be wrong view.
‘In the same way, Lohicca, if anyone should say: 
“Suppose an ascetic or Brahmin were to discover some good doctrine and thought he ought not to declare it to anyone else, for what can one man do for another?” 


he would be a source of danger to those young men of good family who, following the Dhamma and discipline taught by the Tathāgata, attain to such excellent distinction as to realise the fruit of Stream-Entry, of Once-Returning, of Non-Returning, of Arahantship — and to all who ripen the seeds of a rebirth in the deva-world.^f235
 Being a source of danger to them, he is uncompassionate, and his heart is grounded in hostility, and that constitutes wrong view, which leads to ... 
hell or an animal rebirth.
^n512 ‘And if anyone were to speak thus of King Pasenadi, he would be a source of danger to the King’s tenants, yourself and others...
(^i[as verse 13)]  












^n513 ‘Lohicca, these three kinds of teachers in the world are blameworthy,
 and if anyone blames such teachers, his blame is proper, true, in accordance with reality and faultless. 
Which three? 
Here, Lohicca, is a teacher who has gone forth from the household life into homelessness, but who has not gained the goal of asceticism. 
And without having gained this goal, he teaches his disciples a doctrine,^f236 saying: 
“This is for your good, this is for your happiness.” 
But his pupils don’t wish to hear, they don’t listen, the don’t arouse the thought of enlightenment, and the teacher’s instructions are flouted. 
He should be blamed, saying: 
“This venerable one has gone forth ...,
 his instructions are flouted. 

It is just as if a man were to persist in making advances to a woman who rejected him, and to embrace her though she turned away.” 
This I declare to be an evil doctrine based on attachment, for what can one man do for another?^f237
 
This is the first teacher who is blameworthy ...

^n514 ‘Again, there is a teacher who has gone forth... but who has not gained the goal of asceticism. 
Without having gained this goal, he teaches his disciples a doctrine, saying: 
“This is for your good, this is for your happiness.” 
His pupils wish to hear, they listen, they rouse the thought of enlightenment, and the teacher’s instructions are not flouted. 
He should be blamed, saying: 
“This venerable one has gone forth ...” 


It is as if, leaving his own field, he should think another’s field in need of weeding. 
I declare this to be an evil doctrine rooted in attachment...This is the second teacher who is blameworthy ...

^n515 ‘Again, there is a teacher who has gone forth ... 
and who has gained the goal of asceticism. 
Having gone forth, he teaches ... 
But his pupils don’t wish to hear him, ... his instructions are flouted. 


He too should be blamed...


Just as if, having cut through an old fetter, one were to make a new one,
 I declare that this is an evil doctrine rooted in attachment, for what can one man do for another? 
This is the third teacher who is blameworthy... 

And these are the three kinds of teacher that I spoke of as blameworthy.’

^n516 Then Lohicca said: 
‘Reverend Gotama, are there any teachers in the world who are not blameworthy?’


‘Here, Lohicca, a Tathāgata arises in the world, an Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed. He, having realised it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world with its devas, māras and Brahmas, its princes and people. He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life. 
^i[A disciple goes forth and practises the moralities, guards the sense-doors, attains the first jhāna (Sutta 2, verses 41-76).] And whenever the pupil of a teacher attains to such excellent distinction, that is a teacher who is not to be blamed in the world. And if anyone blames that teacher, his blame is improper, untrue, not in accordance with reality, and faulty.
^i[‘He attains the other three jhānas (as Sutta 2, verses 77-]82) ^i[and various insights (Sutta 2, verses 83-84]). 
Whenever the pupil of a teacher attains to such excellent distinction, that is a teacher who is not to be blamed in the world...









‘^i[He realises the Four Noble Truths, the path, and the cessation of the corruptions ... 
(as Sutta 2, verses 85-97)] ‘Whenever the pupil of a teacher attains to such excellent distinction, that is a teacher who is not to be blamed in the world. 
And if anyone blames that teacher, his blame is improper, untrue, not in accordance with reality, and faulty.’
^n517 At this the Brahmin Lohicca said to the Lord: 
‘Reverend Gotama, it is as if a man were to seize someone by the hair who had stumbled and was falling into a pit,^f238 and to set him on firm ground —
 just so, I, who was falling into the pit, have been saved by the Reverend Gotama! 
Excellent, Reverend Gotama, excellent! 
It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there. Just so the Reverend Gotama has expounded the Dhamma in various ways.’
‘I go for refuge to the Lord Gotama, the Dhamma and the Sangha. 
May the Reverend Gotama accept me as a lay-follower who has taken refuge from this day forth for as long as life shall last!’

^ck#d13(^z1[Tevijja Sutta: The Threefold Knowledge] ^h[The Way to Brahma] )^n518 THUS HAVE I HEARD.
 Once the Lord was touring Kosala with a large company of some five hundred monks. 
He came to a Kosalan Brahmin village called Manasakata, and stayed to the north of the village in a mango-grove on the bank of the River Aciravati.
^n519 And at that time many very well-known and prosperous Brahmins were staying at Manasakata,
 including Canki, Tārukkha, Pokkharasati, Jāṇussoni, and Todeyya.
^n520 And Vasettha and Bharadvaja went strolling along the road, and as they did so, an argument broke out between them on the subject of right and wrong paths. 
The young Brahmin Vasettha said:
 ‘This is the only straight path, this is the direct path, the path of salvation that leads one who follows it to union with Brahma, as is taught by the Brahmin Pokkharasāti!’^f239
And the young Brahmin Bharadvaja said:
 ‘^i[This] is the only straight path... as taught by the Brahmin Tarukkha!’
And Vasettha could not convince Bharadvaja, nor could Bharadvaja convince Vasettha. 
^n521 Then Vasettha said to Bharadvaja: 
‘This ascetic Gotama is staying to the north of the village, and concerning this Blessed Lord a good report has been spread about... 
(^i[as Sutta 4, verse] 2). 

Let us go to the ascetic Gotama and ask him,
 and whatever he tells us, we shall accept.’ 
And Bharadvaja agreed.
^n522 So the two of them went to see the Lord.
 Having exchanged courtesies with him, they sat down to one side, and Vasettha said: ‘Reverend Gotama, as we were strolling along the road, we got to discussing right and wrong paths. I said: 
“This is the only straight path... 
as is taught by the Brahmin Pokkharasati”
, and Bhāradvāja said: 
“This ^i[is] the only straight path...
as is taught by the Brahmin Tārukkha.” 
This is our dispute, our quarrel, our difference.’ 
^n523 ‘So, Vāseṭṭha, you say that
 the way to union with Brahmā is that taught by the Brahmin Pokkharasāti
, and Bhāradvāja says
 it is that taught by the Brahmin Tārukha. 
What is the dispute, the quarrel, the difference all about?’
^n524 ‘Right and wrong paths, Reverend Gotama
. There are so many kinds of Brahmins who teach different paths: the Addhariya, the Tittiriya, the Chandoka, the Chandāva, the Brahmacariya ^f240 Brahmins —
 do all these ways lead to union with Brahmā? Just as if there were near a town or village many different paths — do all these come together at that place? 
And likewise, do the ways of the various Brahmins...lead the one who follows them to union with Brahmā?’
^n525 ‘You say: “They lead”, Vaseṭṭha?’
 ‘I say: “They lead”, Reverend Gotama.’
 ‘You say: “They lead”, Vaseṭṭha?’
 ‘I say: “They lead”, Reverend Gotama.’
 ‘You say: “They lead”, Vasettha?’ 
‘I say: “They lead”, Reverend Gotama.’ 
‘But, Vāseṭṭha, is there then a single one of these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas who has seen Brahmā face to face?’
 ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Then has the teacher’s teacher of any one of them seen Brahmā face to face?’ 
‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Then has the ancestor seven generations back of the teacher of one of them seen Brahmā face to face?’ 
‘No, Reverend Gotama.’


^n526 ‘Well then, Vaseṭṭha, what about the early sages of those Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas, the makers of the mantras, the expounders of the mantras, whose ancient verses are chanted, pronounced and collected by the Brahmins of today, and sung and spoken about — such as Atthaka, Vāmaka, Vāmadeva, Vessāmitta, Yamataggi, Angirasa, Bhāradvāja, Vāsettha, Kassapa, Bhagu^f241 -
 did they ever say: 
“We know and see when, how and where Brahmā appears”?’^f242
 ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
^n527 ‘So, Vāseṭṭha, not one of these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas has seen Brahmā face to face,
 nor has one of their teachers,
 or teacher’s teachers,
 nor even the ancestor seven generations back of one of their teachers. 
Nor could any of the early sages say: 
“We know and see when, how and where Brahmā appears.” 
So what these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas are saying is: 
“We teach this path to union with Brahmā that we do not know or see, this is the only straight path...
leading to union with Brahmā.” 
^n528 What do you think, Vāseṭṭha? 
Such being the case, does not what these Brahmins declare turn out to be ill-founded?’ 
‘Yes indeed, Reverend Gotama.’
 ‘Well, Vāseṭṭha, when these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas teach a path that they do not know or see, saying: “This is the only straight path ... ”,this cannot possibly be right. Just as a file of blind men go on, clinging to each other, and the first one sees nothing, the middle one sees nothing, and the last one sees nothing^f243- so it is with the talk of these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas: 
^n529 the first one sees nothing, the middle one sees nothing, the last one sees nothing. 
The talk of these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas turns out to be laughable, mere words, empty and vain.

^n530 ‘What do you think, Vāseṭṭha?
 Do these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas see the sun and moon just as other people do, and when the sun and moon rise and set do they pray, sing praises and worship with clasped hands?’ 
‘They do, Reverend Gotama.’
^n531 ‘What do you think, Vāseṭṭha?
 These Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas, who can see the sun and moon just as other people do, ... can they point out a way to union with the sun and moon, saying:
 “This is the only straight path... that leads to union with the sun and moon”?’ 
‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
‘So, Vāseṭṭha, these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas cannot point out a way to union with the sun and moon, which they have seen. 

^n532 And, too, none of them has seen Brahmā face to face,...


nor has even the ancestor seven generations back of one of their teachers. 
Nor could any of the early sages say: 
“We know and see when, how and where Brahmā appears.” 
Does not what these Brahmins declare turn out to be ill-founded?’ 
‘Yes indeed, Reverend Gotama.’
^n533 



^n534 ‘Vaseṭṭha, it is just as if a man were to say:
 “I am going to seek out and love the most beautiful girl in the country.”
 They might say to him: 
“... Do you know
 what caste she belongs to?” 
“No.” 

“Well, do you know her name, her clan, whether she is tall or short..., dark or light-complexioned..., or where she comes from?” 
“No.” 
And they might say:
 “Well then, you don’t know or see the one you seek for and desire?” 
and he would say: “No.” 
^n535 Does not the talk of that man
 turn out to be stupid?’ 
‘Certainly, Reverend Gotama.’
^n536 ‘Then, Vāseṭṭha, it is like this: 
not one of these Brahmins ... 

has seen Brahmā face to face, nor has one of their teachers ...’ 
‘Yes indeed, Reverend Gotama.’
‘That is right, Vāseṭṭha. 
^n537

 When these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas teach a path that they do not know and see, this cannot possibly be right.
^n538 ‘Vāseṭṭha, it is just as if a man were to build a staircase for a palace at a crossroads. 
People might say:
 “This staircase for a palace — do you know whether the palace will face east or west, north or south, or whether it will be high, low or of medium height?”
 and he would say: “No.”
 And they might say:
 “Well then, you don’t know or see what kind of a palace you are building the staircase for?”
 and he would say: “No.”
^n539  Does not the talk of that man
 turn out to be stupid?’ 
‘Certainly, Reverend Gotama.’
^n540 




^n541 (^i[as verse 20])  


^n542 ‘Vāseṭṭha, it is just as if this River Aciravatī were brimful of water so that a crow could drink out of it,
 and a man should come along wishing to cross over, to get to the other side, to get across, and,
 standing on this bank, were to call out: 
“Come here, other bank, come here!”
^n543 What do you think, Vasettha?
 Would the other bank of the River Aciravati come over to this side on account of that man’s calling, begging, requesting or wheedling?’ 
 ‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
^n544 ‘Well now, Vasettha, those Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas who persistently neglect what a Brahmin should do, and persistently do what a Brahmin should not do, declare:
 “We call on Indra, Soma, Varuna, Isana, Pajapati, Brahma, Mahiddhi, Yama.” But that such Brahmins who persistently neglect what a Brahmin should do, ... will,
 as a consequence of their calling, begging, requesting or wheedling, attain after death, at the breaking-up of the body, to union with Brahmā — that is just not possible.
^n545 ‘Vasettha, it is just as if this River Aciravati were brimful of water so that a crow could drink out of it,
 and a man should come wishing to cross over,... 
but he was bound and pinioned on this side by a strong chain, with his hands behind his back. 
What do you think, Vasettha? 
Would that man be able to get to the other side?’ 
‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
^n546 ‘In just the same way, Vasettha, in the Ariyan discipline these five strands of sense-desire are called bonds and fetters.
 Which five? 
Forms seen by the eye which are agreeable, loved, charming, attractive, pleasurable, arousing desire;
 sounds heard by the ear... ;
 smells smelt by the nose ... ;
 tastes savoured by the tongue...;
 contacts felt by the body which are agreeable,... arousing desire. 
These five in the Ariyan discipline are called bonds and fetters. 
And, Vasettha, those Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas are enslaved, infatuated by these five strands of sense-desire, which they enjoy guiltily, unaware of danger, knowing no way out.
‘But that such Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas, who persistently neglect what a Brahmin should do,...who are enslaved by these five strands of sense-desire, ... knowing no way out, should attain after death, at the breaking-up of the body, to union with Brahmā — that is just not possible. 
^n547 ‘It is just as if this River Aciravati were brimful of water so that a crow could drink out of it,
 and a man should come along wishing to cross over... 
and were to lie down on this bank, covering his head with a shawl. 
What do you think, Vasettha? 
Would that man be able to get to the other side?’ 
‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
^n548 ‘In the same way, Vasettha, in the Ariyan discipline these five hindrances are called obstacles, hindrances, coverings-up, envelopings.
 Which five? The hindrance of sensuality, of ill-will, of sloth-and-torpor, of worry-and-flurry, of doubt.
 These five are called obstacles, hindrances, coverings-up, envelopings. 
And these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas are caught up, hemmed in, obstructed, entangled in these five hindrances. 
^n549 But that such Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas, who persistently neglect what a Brahmin should do... and who are caught up,...  entangled in these five hindrances,
 should attain after death, at the breaking-up of the body, to union with Brahmā - that is just not possible.
^n550 ‘What do you think, Vāsettha?
 What have you heard said by Brahmins who are venerable, aged, the teachers of teachers? Is Brahmā encumbered with wives and wealth,^f244 or unencumbered?’
 ‘Unencumbered, Reverend Gotama.’
 ‘Is he full of hate or without hate?’
 ‘Without hate, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Is he full of ill-will or without ill-will?’ 
‘Without ill-will, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Is he impure or pure?’ 
‘Pure, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Is he disciplined^f245 or undisciplined?’ 
‘Disciplined, Reverend Gotama.’
‘And what do you think, Vāsettha?
 Are the Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas encumbered with wives and wealth, or unencumbered?’
 ‘Encumbered, Reverend Gotama.’
 ‘Are they full of hate or without hate?’
 ‘Full of hate, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Are they full of ill-will or without ill-will?’ 
‘Full of ill-will, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Are they impure or pure?’ 
‘Impure, Reverend Gotama.’
‘Are they disciplined or undisciplined?’ 
‘Undisciplined, Reverend Gotama.’
^n551 ‘So, Vāsettha, the Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas are encumbered with wives and wealth, and Brahmā is unencumbered.
 Is there any communion, anything in common between these encumbered Brahmins and the unencumbered Brahmā?’ 
‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
‘That is right, Vāsettha. That these encumbered Brahmins, learned in the Three Vedas, should after death, at the breaking-up of the body, be united with the unencumbered Brahmā — that is just not possible. 
‘Likewise, do these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas and full of hate...,
 full of ill-will..., impure...,
 undisciplined,
 have any communion, anything in common with the disciplined Brahma?’ 
‘No, Reverend Gotama.’
‘That is right, Vasettha. That these undisciplined Brahmins should after death be united with Brahma is just not possible.
^n552 But these Brahmins learned in the Three Vedas, having sat down on the bank, sink down despairingly, thinking maybe to find a dry way across. 
 Therefore their threefold knowledge is called the threefold desert, the threefold wilderness, the threefold destruction.’
^n553 At these words Vasettha said: 
‘Reverend Gotama, I have heard them say: “The ascetic Gotama knows the way to union with Brahmā.”’
‘What do you think, Vasettha? 


^n554
 Suppose there were a man here born and brought up in Manasakata,
 and somebody who had come from Manasakata and and had missed the road should ask him the way. 
Would that man, born and bred in Manasakata, be in a state of confusion or perplexity?’ 
‘No, Reverend Gotama. 
And why not? 
Because such a man would know all the paths.’
‘Vasettha, it might be said that such a man on being asked the way might be confused or perplexed — but the Tathagata, on being asked about the Brahma world and the way to get there, would certainly not be confused or perplexed.
 For, Vasettha, I know Brahma and the world of Brahma, and the way to the world of Brahma, and the path of practice whereby the world of Brahma may be gained.’
^n555 At this Vasettha said:
 ‘Reverend Gotama, I have heard them say: “The ascetic Gotama teaches the way to union with Brahma.”
 It would be good if the Reverend Gotama were to teach us the way to union with Brahma, may the Reverend Gotama help the people of Brahma!’ 
‘Then, Vāsettha, listen, pay proper attention, and I will tell you.’ 
‘Very good, Reverend Sir’, said Vasettha. 
^n556 The Lord said:
‘Vasettha, a Tathagata arises in the world, an Arabant, fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed. He, having realised it by his own super-knowledge, proclaims this world with its devas, māras and Brahmas, its princes and people.
 He preaches the Dhamma which is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and displays the fully-perfected and purified holy life. 
^i[A disciple goes forth, practises the moralities, attains the first jhāna (as Sutta 2, verses 43-75).]
‘Then, with his heart filled with loving-kindness, he dwells suffusing one quarter, the second, the third, the fourth. Thus he dwells suffusing the whole world, upwards, downwards, across, everywhere, always with a heart filled with loving-kindness, abundant, unbounded,^f246 without hate or ill-will. 
‘Just as if a mighty trumpeter were with little difficulty to make a proclamation to the four quarters,
 so by this meditation, Vasettha, by this liberation of the heart through loving-kindness he leaves nothing untouched, nothing unaffected in the sensuous sphere.^f247
 This, Vasettha, is the way to union with Brahma.
‘Then with his heart filled with compassion,...
 with sympathetic joy,
 with equanimity he dwells suffusing one quarter, the second, the third, the fourth. Thus he dwells suffusing the whole world, upwards, downwards, across, everywhere, always with a heart filled with equanimity, abundant, unbounded, without hate or ill-will.
‘Just as if a mighty trumpeter were with little difficulty to make a proclamation to the four quarters,
 so by this meditation, Vāsettha, by this liberation of the heart through compassion,... through sympathetic joy,... through equanimity, he leaves nothing untouched, nothing unaffected in the sensuous sphere. 
This, Vāsettha, is the way to union with Brahma.
^n557 ‘What do you think, Vasettha? 
Is a monk dwelling thus encumbered with wives and wealth or unencumbered?’ 
‘Unencumbered, Reverend Gotama. 

He is without hate...,

 without ill-will...,
 
pure and disciplined, Reverend Gotama.’ 


‘Then, Vasettha, the monk is unencumbered, and Brahma is unencumbered.
 Has that unencumbered monk anything in common with the unencumbered Brahma?’
 ‘Yes indeed, Reverend Gotama.’ 
‘That is right, Vāsettha. Then that an unencumbered monk, after death, at the breaking-up of the body, should attain to union with the unencumbered Brahmā — that is possible. 
^n558 Likewise a monk without hate...,
 without ill-will...,
 pure...,
 disciplined... 

Then that a disciplined monk, after death, at the breaking-up of the body, should attain to union with Brahmā — that is possible.’
^n559 At this the young Brahmins Vāsettha and Bhāradvāja said to the Lord:
 ‘Excellent, Reverend Gotama, excellent! 
It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there. Just so the Reverend Gotama has expounded the Dhamma in various ways.’
‘We take refuge in the Reverend Gotama, in the Dhamma, and in the Sangha. 
May the Reverend Gotama accept us as lay-followers having taken refuge from this day forth as long as life shall last!’^f248
