Once the Lord was staying among the Mallas. Anupiya is the name of a Malla town, 
and the Lord, having dressed in the early morning and taken his robe and bowl, went to Anupiya for alms. 
Then he thought: 
‘It is too early for me to go into Anupiya for alms. 
Suppose I were to visit the hermitage^f2 of the wanderer Bhaggava-gotta?’ 
^n2 And he did so.  
And the wanderer Bhaggava-gotta said: 
‘Come, Blessed Lord, 
welcome, Blessed Lord! 
At last the Blessed Lord has gone out of his way to come here. 
Be seated, Lord, a seat is prepared.’ 
The Lord sat down on the prepared seat, 
and Bhaggava took a low stool and sat down to one side. 
Then he said: 
‘Lord, a few days ago Sunakkhatta the Licchave^f3 came to me and said: 
“Bhaggava, I have left the Blessed Lord. 
I am no longer under his rule.” 
Is that really so, Lord?’ 
‘It is true, Bhaggava.^f4
^n3 ‘A few days ago, Sunakkhatta came to me, saluted me, sat down to one side, and said: 
“Lord, I am leaving the Blessed Lord, 
I am no longer under the Lord’s rule.” 
So I said to him: 
“Well, Sunakkhatta, did I ever say to you: 
‘Come, Sunakkhatta, be under my rule’?” 
“No, Lord.” 
“Or did you ever say to me: 
‘Lord, I will be under your rule’?” 
“No, Lord.” 
“So, Sunakkhatta, if I did not say that 
to you 
and you did not 
say that to me — 
you foolish man, who are you and what are you giving up? 
Consider, foolish man, how far the fault is yours.”
^n4 “‘Well, Lord, you have not performed any miracles.”^f5
 “And did I ever say to you: 
‘Come under my rule, Sunakkhatta, and I will perform miracles for you’?” 
“No, Lord.” 
“Or did you ever say to me: 
‘Lord, I will be under your rule if you will perform miracles for me’?” 
“No, Lord.” 
“Then it appears, Sunakkhatta, that I made no such promises, and you made no such conditions. 



Such being the case, you foolish man, who are you and what are you giving up?
‘“What do you think, Sunakkhatta? 
Whether miracles are performed or not — is it the purpose of my teaching Dhamma to lead whoever practises it^f6 to the total destruction of suffering?” 
“It is, Lord.” 
“So, Sunakkhatta, whether miracles are performed or not, the purpose of my teaching Dhamma is to lead whoever practises it to the total destruction of suffering. 
Then what purpose would the performance of miracles serve? 
Consider, you foolish man, how far the fault is yours.”
^n5 “‘Well, Lord, you do not teach the beginning of things.” 
“And did I ever say to you: 
‘Come under my rule, Sunakkhatta, and I will teach you the beginning of things’?” 
“No, Lord.” 
... 











Such being the case, 
you foolish man, who are you and what are you giving up? 
^n6 ‘“Sunakkhatta, you have in many ways spoken in praise of me among the Vajjians, saying: 
‘This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, the Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, the Buddha, the Blessed Lord.’ 

You have in many ways spoken in praise of the Dhamma, saying: 
‘Well-proclaimed by the Blessed Lord is the Dhamma, visible here and now, timeless, inviting inspection, leading onward, to be realised by the wise, each one for himself.’ 

You have in many ways spoken in praise of the order of monks, saying: 
‘Well-trained is the order of the Lord’s disciples, trained in uprightness, methodically-trained, excellently-trained is the order of the Lord’s disciples, that is, the four pairs of men, the eight classes of individuals. This is the order of the Lord’s disciples, worthy of respect, worthy of homage, worthy of gifts, worthy of salutation, an unsurpassed field in the world for merit.’
‘“In these ways you have spoken in praise of me, of the Dhamma, and of the order among the Vajjians. 
And I say to you, I declare to you, Sunakkhatta, there will be those who will say: 
‘Sunakkhatta the Licchavi was unable to maintain the holy life under the ascetic Gotama, and being thus unable he abandoned the training and reverted to a base life.’^f7
 That, Sunakkhatta, is what they will say.” 
And, Bhaggava, at my words Sunakkhatta left this Dhamma and discipline like one condemned to hell.
^n7 ‘Once, Bhaggava, I was staying among the Khulus,^f8 at a place called Uttarakā, a town of theirs. 
In the early morning I went with robe and bowl into Uttarakā for alms, with Sunakkhatta as my attendant. 
And at that time the naked ascetic Korakkhattiya the “dog-man”^f9 was going round on all fours, sprawling on the ground, and chewing and eating his food with his mouth alone. 
Seeing him, Sunakkhatta 
thought: 
“Now that is a real Arahant ascetic, who goes round on all fours, sprawling on the ground, and chewing and eating his food with his mouth alone.” 
And I, knowing his thought in my own mind, said to him: 
“You foolish man, do you claim to be a follower of the Sakyan?” 
“Lord, what do you mean by this question?” 

“Sunakkhatta, did you not, on seeing that naked ascetic going around on all fours, think: 
‘Now that is a real Arahant ascetic, who goes round on all fours, sprawling on the ground, and chewing and eating his food with his mouth alone’?” 
“I did, Lord. 
Does the Blessed Lord begrudge others their Arahantship?” 
“I do not begrudge others their Arahantship, you foolish man! 
It is only in you that this evil view has arisen. 
Cast it aside lest it should be to your harm and sorrow for a long time! 
This naked ascetic Korakkhattiya, whom you regard as a true Arahant, will die in seven days from indigestion, ^f10 
and when he is dead he will reappear among the Kālakañja asuras, who are the very lowest grade of asuras.^f11
 And when he is dead he will be cast aside on a heap of ^i[bῑraṇa-]grass in the charnel-ground. 
If you want to, Sunakkhatta, you can go to him and ask him 
if he knows his fate. 
And it may be that he will tell you: 
‘Friend Sunakkhatta, I know my fate. 
I have been reborn among the Kālakañja asuras, the very lowest grade of asuras.’”
‘Then Sunakkhatta went to Korakkhattiya and told him what I had prophesied, adding: 
“Therefore, friend Korakkhattiya, be very careful what you eat and drink, so that the ascetic Gotama’s words may be proved wrong!” 
And Sunakkhatta was so sure that the Tathāgata’s words would be proved wrong that he counted up the seven days one by one. 
But on the seventh day Korakkhattiya died of indigestion, and when he was dead he reappeared among the Kālakañja asuras, 
and his body was cast aside on a heap of ^i[bῑraṇa-]grass in the charnel-ground.


^n8 



^n9 ‘And Sunakkhatta heard of this, 

so he went to the heap of ^i[bῑraṇa]-grass in the charnel-ground where Korakkhattiya was lying, struck the body three times with his hand, and said: 
“Friend Korakkhattiya, do you know your fate?” 
And Korakkhattiya sat up and rubbed his back with his hand, and said: 
“Friend Sunakkhatta, I know my fate. 
I have been reborn among the Kālakañja asuras, the very lowest grade of asuras.” And with that, he fell back again.
^n10 ‘Then Sunakkhatta came to me, saluted me, and sat down to one side. And I said to him: “Well, Sunakkhatta, what do you think? 
Has what I told you about the ‘dog-man’ Korakkhattiya come true or not?” 
“It has come about the way you said, Lord, and not otherwise.” 
“Well, what do you think, Sunakkhatta? 
Has a miracle been performed or not?” 
“Certainly, Lord, this being so, a miracle has been performed, and not otherwise.” 
“Well then, you foolish man, do you still say to me, after I have performed such a miracle: 
‘Well, Lord, you have not performed any miracles’? 
Consider, you foolish man, how far the fault is yours.” 
And at my words Sunakkhatta left this Dhamma and discipline like one condemned to hell.

^n11 ‘Once, Bhaggava, I was staying at Vesali, at the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest. 
And at that time there was a naked ascetic living in Vesālῑ called Kaḷāramuṭṭhaka^f12 who enjoyed great gains and fame in the Vajjian capital. 
He had undertaken seven rules of practice: 
“As long as I live I will be a naked ascetic and will not put on any clothes; as long as I live I will remain chaste and abstain from sexual intercourse; as long as I live I will subsist on strong drink and meat, abstaining from boiled rice and sour milk; as long as I live I will never go beyond the Udena shrine to the east of Vesāli, the Gotamaka shrine to the south, the Sattamba shrine to the west, nor the Bahuputta shrine to the north.”^f13
 And it was through having undertaken these seven rules that he enjoyed the greatest gains and fame of all in the Vajjian capital.

^n12 ‘Now Sunakkhatta went to see Kaḷāramuṭṭhaka and asked him a question 
which he could not answer, 
and because he could not answer it he showed signs of anger, rage and petulance. 
But Sunakkhatta thought: 
“I might cause this real Arahant ascetic offence. 
I don’t want anything to happen that would be to my lasting harm and misfortune!”
^n13 ‘Then Sunakkhatta came to me, saluted me, and sat down to one side. I said to him: 
“You foolish man, do you claim to be a follower of the Sakyan?” 
“Lord, what do you mean by this question?” 
“Sunakkhatta, did you not go to see Kaḷāramuṭṭhaka 
and ask him a question 
he could not answer, 
and did he not thereupon show signs of anger, rage and petulance? 
And did you not think: 
‘I might cause this real Arahant ascetic offence. 
I don’t want anything to happen that would be to my lasting harm and misfortune’?” 
“I did, Lord. 
Does the Blessed Lord begrudge others their Arahantship?” 
“I do not begrudge others their Arahantship, you foolish man. 
It is only in you that this evil view has arisen. 
Cast it aside lest it should be to your harm and sorrow for a long time! 
This naked ascetic Kaḷāramuṭṭhaka, whom you regard as a true Arahant, will before long be living clothed and married, subsisting on boiled rice and sour milk. 
He will go beyond all the shrines of Vesālῑ, and will die having entirely lost his reputation.” 
And indeed all this came about.
^n14 ‘Then Sunakkhatta, having heard what had happened, came to me...

And I said: 
“Well, Sunakkhatta, what do you think? 
Has what I told you about Kaḷaramuṭṭhaka come about, or not? 
... 

Has a miracle been performed or not?” 
... 



And at my words Sunakkhatta left this Dhamma and discipline like one condemned to hell.
^n15 ‘Once, Bhaggava, I was staying at Vesali in the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest. 
And at that time there was a naked ascetic living in Vesālῑ called Patikaputta, who enjoyed great gains and fame in the Vajjian capital. 
And he made this declaration in the assembly of Vesālῑ: 
“The ascetic Gotama claims to be a man of wisdom, and I make the same claim. 
It is right that a man of wisdom should show it by performing miracles. 
If the ascetic Gotama will come half-way to meet me, I will do likewise. 
Then we could both work miracles, 
and if the ascetic Gotama performs one miracle, I will perform two. 
If he performs two, I will perform four. 
And if he performs four, I will perform eight. 
However many miracles the ascetic Gotama performs, I will perform twice as many!”
^n16 ‘Then Sunakkhatta came to me, saluted me, sat down to one side, and told me what Patikaputta had said. 










I said: 
“Sunakkhatta, that naked ascetic Patikaputta is not capable of meeting me face to face unless he takes back his words, abandons that thought, and gives up that view. 
And if he thinks 
otherwise, his head will split in pieces.”^f14
^n17 ‘“Lord, let the Blessed Lord have a care what he says, let the Well-Farer have a care what he says!” 
“What do you mean by saying that to me?” 

“Lord, the Blessed Lord might make an absolute statement
 about Patikaputta’s coming. 


But he might come in some altered shape, and thus falsify the Blessed Lord’s words!”
^n18 ‘“But, Sunakkhatta, would the Tathagata make any statement that was ambiguous?” 
“Lord, does the Blessed Lord know by his own mind what would happen to Patikaputta? 
Or has some deva told the Tathagata?” 
“Sunakkhatta, I know it by my own mind, and I have also been told by a deva. 
For Ajita, the general of the Licchavis, died the other day and has been reborn in the company of the Thirty-Three Gods. 
He came to see me and told me: 
‘Lord, Patikaputta the naked ascetic is an impudent liar! 
He declared in the Vajjian capital: 
“Ajita, the general of the Licchavis, has been reborn in the great hell!” 
^n19 But I have not been reborn in the great hell, but in the company of the Thirty-Three Gods. 
He is an impudent liar...’ 

























Thus, Sunakkhatta, I know what I have said by my own mind, but I have also been told by a deva. 
And now, Sunakkhatta, I will go into Vesālῑ for alms. On my return, after I have eaten, I will go for my midday rest to Pāṭikaputta’s park. 
You may tell him whatever you wish.” 
^n20 ‘Then, having dressed, I took my robe and bowl and went into Vesālῑ for alms. 
On my return I went to Patikaputta’s park for my midday rest. 
Meanwhile Sunakkhatta rushed into Vesālῑ and declared to all the prominent Licchavis: 
“Friends, the Blessed Lord has gone into Vesālῑ for alms, and after that he has gone for his midday rest to Pātṭkaputta’s park. 
Come along, friends, come along! the two great ascetics are going to work miracles!” 
And all the prominent Licchavis thought: 
“The two great ascetics are going to work miracles! 
Let us go along!” 
And he went to the distinguished and wealthy Brahmins and householders, and to the ascetics and Brahmins of various schools, and told them the same thing, 
and they too thought: 



“Let us go along!” 
And so all these people came along to Paṭikaputta’s park, 
hundreds and thousands of them.
^n21 ‘And Pāṭikaputta heard that 
all these people had come to his park, 
and that the ascetic Gotama had gone there for his midday rest. 
And at the news he was overcome with fear and trembling, and his hair stood on end. 
And thus terrified and trembling, his hair standing on end, he made for the Tinduka lodging of the wanderers.^f15
 When the assembled company heard that 
he had gone to the Tinduka lodging, they instructed a man to go there to Pāṭikaputta 
and say to him: 
“Friend Pāṭikaputta, come along! All these people have come to your park,
 and the ascetic Gotama has gone there for his midday rest. 
Because you declared to the assembly at Vesālῑ: 
‘The ascetic Gotama claims to be a man of wisdom, and I make the same claim ... 
(as verse 15). 


However many miracles he performs, I will perform twice as many!’ 



So now come half-way: 
the ascetic Gotama has already come half-way to meet you, and is sitting for his midday rest in Your Reverence’s park.”
^n22 ‘The man went and delivered the message, and on hearing it Pāṭikaputta said: 








“I’m coming, friend, coming!” but, wriggle as he might, he could not get up from his seat. 
Then the man said: 
“What’s the matter with you, friend Pāṭikaputta? Is your bottom stuck to the seat, or is the seat stuck to your bottom? 
You keep saying: ‘I’m coming, friend, I’m coming!’, but you only wriggle and can’t get up from your seat.” 
And even at these words, Pāṭikaputta still wriggled about, but could not rise.
^n23 ‘And when that man realised that 
Pāṭikaputta could not help himself, 
he went back to the assembly and reported the situation. 



And then I said to them: 
“Pāṭikaputta the naked ascetic is not capable of meeting me face to face unless he takes back his words, abandons that thought, and gives up that view. 
And if he thinks otherwise, 
his head will split in pieces.”’
 ^i[End of first recitation-section〕] 
^n24 ‘Then, Bhaggava, one of the ministers of the Licchavis rose from his seat and said: 
“Well, gentlemen, just wait a little till I I have been to see whether 
I can bring Pāṭikaputta to the assembly.” 
So he went to the Tinduka lodging and said to Pāṭikaputta: 
“Come along, Pāṭikaputta, it is best for you to come. All these people have come to your park and the ascetic Gotama has gone there for his midday rest. 









If you come, we will make you the winner and let the ascetic Gotama be defeated.”
‘And Pāṭikaputta said: “I’m coming, friend, I’m coming”, but wriggle as he might, he could not get up from his seat...




^n25 ‘So the minister returned to the assembly and reported on the situation. 



Then I said: 
“Pāṭikaputta, is not capable of meeting me ... 


Even if the good Licchavis were to think: 
‘Let us bind him with thongs and try to drag him with yoked oxen!’ 
he would burst the thongs. 
He is not capable of meeting me face to face ... ” 

^n26 ‘Then Jāliya, a pupil of the wooden-bowl ascetic,^f16 rose from his seat...


, went to the Tinduka lodging and said to Pāṭikaputta: 
“Come along, Pāṭikaputta,...














if you come, we will make you the winner and let the ascetic Gotama be defeated.” 
‘And Pāṭikaputta said: “I’m coming, friend, I’m coming!” but wriggle as he might, he could not get up from his seat...




^n27 ‘Then, when Jaliya realised the situation, 
he said: 
“Patikaputta, once long ago the lion, king of beasts, thought: 
‘Suppose I were to make my lair near a certain jungle. 
Then I could emerge in the evening, yawn, survey the four quarters, roar my lion’s roar three times, and then make for the cattle-pasture. 
I could then pick out the very best of the herd for my kill and, having had a good feast of tender meat, return to my lair.’ 
And he did accordingly. 


^n28 “‘Now there was an old jackal who had grown fat on the lion’s leavings, and he was proud and strong. 
And he thought: 
‘What difference is there between me and the lion, king of beasts? 
Suppose I were to make my lair near the jungle...’
 So he chose a lair accordingly and emerging in the evening, he surveyed the four quarters, and then thought: 
‘Now I will roar a lion’s roar three times’, - 
and he gave out the howl of his kind, a jackal howl. 
For what has the wretched howl of a jackal in common with a lion’s roar? 
In just the same way, Pāṭikaputta, you live off the achievements of the Well-Farer and feed on the Well-Farer’s leavings, imagining you can set yourself up beside the Tathagatas, Arahants and fully-enlightened Buddhas. 
But what have wretched Patikaputtas in common with them?”
^n29 ‘Then, being unable even with the aid of this parable to get Pāṭikaputta, to rise from his seat, 
Jāliya uttered this verse:  
“Thinking himself a lion, 
the jackal says: ‘I’m the king of beasts’, 
and tries to roar A lion’s roar, but only howls instead. 
Lion is lion and jackal jackal still.
In just the same way, Patikaputta, you are living off the achievements of the Well-Farer...”

^n30 ‘And, being unable even with the aid of this parable to get Patikaputta to rise from his seat, 
Jāliya uttered this verse:
“Following another’s tracks, and fed 
On scraps, his jackal-nature he forgets, 
Thinking: 
‘I’m a tiger’, tries to roar 
A mighty roar, but only howls instead. 
Lion is lion and jackal’s jackal still.
In just the same way, Patikaputta, you are living off the achievements of the Well-Farer...”

^n31 ‘And, being unable even with this parable to get Pāṭikaputta, to rise from his seat, 
Jāliya uttered this verse:
“Gorged on frogs and mice from threshing-floors, 
And corpses cast aside in charnel-grounds, 
In lonely forests wild the jackal thinks: 
‘I’m the king of beasts’, and tries to roar 
A lion’s roar, but only howls instead. 
Lion is lion and jackal’s jackal still.
In just the same way, Pāṭikaputta, you are living off the achievements of the Well-Farer, feeding on the Well-Farer’s leavings, imagine you can set yourself up beside the Tathāgatas, Arahants and full-enlightened Buddhas. 
But what have wretched Pāṭikaputtas in common with them?”
^n32 ‘Then, being unable even with this parable to get Pāṭikaputta to rise from his seat, 
Jāliya returned to the assembly and reported on the situation.

^n33 ‘Then I said: 
“Pāṭikaputtas is not capable of meeting me face to face unless he takes back his words, abandons that thought and gives up that view... 
Even if the good Licchavis were to think: 
‘Let us bind him with thongs and try to drag him here with yoked oxen’, he would burst the thongs. 

He is not capable of meeting me face to face ... 

If he thinks otherwise, his head will split in pieces.”
^n34 ‘Then, Bhaggava, I instructed, inspired, fired and delighted that assembly with a talk on Dhamma. And having thereby delivered that company from the great bondage,^f17 thus rescuing eighty-four thousand beings from the great path of peril, I entered into the fire-element^f18 and rose into the air to the height of seven palm-trees, and projecting a beam for the height of another seven so that it blazed and shed fragrance, I then reappeared in the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest.^f19 ‘And there Sunakkhatta came to me, saluted me and sat down to one side. 
^n35 I said: 
“What do you think, Sunakkhatta? 
Has what I told you about Pāṭikaputta come about, or not?” 
“It has, Lord.” 
“And has a miracle been performed, or not?” 
“It has, Lord.” 
“Well then, you foolish man, 
do you still say to me after I have performed such a miracle: 
‘Well, Lord, you have not performed any miracles’? 
Consider, you foolish man, how far the fault is yours.” 
And, Bhaggava, at my words Sunakkhatta left this Dhamma and discipline like one condemned to hell.
^n36 ‘Bhaggava, I know the first beginning of things,^f20 and I know not only that, but what surpasses it in value.^f21
 And I am not under the sway of what I know, and not being under its sway I have come to know for myself that quenching,^f22 by the realisation of which the Tathagata cannot fall into perilous paths.^f23
^n37  There are, Bhaggava, some ascetics and Brahmins who declare as their doctrine that all things began with the creation by a god,^f24 or Brahma. 
I have gone to them and said: 
“Reverend sirs, is it true that you declare that all things began with the creation by a god, or Brahma?” 
“Yes”, they replied. 
Then I asked: 
“In that case, how do the reverend teachers declare that this came about?” 
But they could not give an answer, and so they asked me in return. 

^n38 And I replied:‘“There comes a time, friends, sooner or later after a long period, when this world contracts... 



Beings are born in the Abhassara Brahma world and stay there a long time. 
When this world expands, one being falls from there and arises in an empty Brahma palace. 
He longs for company, other beings appear, and he and they believe he created them (Sutta 1, verses 2.2-6). 

That, Reverend Sirs, is how it comes about that you teach that all things began with the creation by a god, or Brahma.” And they said: 
“We have heard this, Reverend Gotama, as you have explained.” 
But I know the first beginning of things... 
^n39 and not being under the sway of what I know I have come to know that quenching by the realisation of which the Tathāgata cannot fall into perilous ways.










^n40 












^n41 ‘There are some ascetics and Brahmins who declare that the beginning of things was due to corruption by pleasure. 
I went to them and asked them 
if this was their view. 
“Yes”, they replied. 
I asked them how this came about, and when they could not explain, I said: 
“There are, friends, certain devas called Corrupted by Pleasure. 
They spend an excessive amount of time addicted to merriment... ^i[their mindfulness lapses, and they fall away (Sutta 1, verses 2.]7 — 9). 

^n42 That, Reverend Sirs, is how it comes about that you teach that the beginning of things was due to corruption by pleasure.” 



And they said: 
“We have heard this, Reverend Gotama, as you have explained.”








^n43 ‘There are some ascetics and Brahmins who declare that the beginning of things was due to corruption of mind. 
I went to them and asked them 
if this was their view. 
“Yes”, they replied. 
I asked them how this came about, and when they could not explain, I said: 
“There are, friends, certain devas called Corrupted in Mind. 
They spend an excessive amount of time regarding each other with envy... ^i[their minds become corrupted, and they fall away (Sutta 1, verses 2.10 — 13)]. 

^n44 That, Reverend Sirs, is how it comes about that you teach that the beginning of things was due to corruption of mind.” 



And they said: 
“We have heard this, Reverend Gotama, as you have explained.”








^n45 ‘There are, Bhaggava, some ascetics and Brahmins who declare that the beginning of things was due to chance. 
I went to them and asked them 
if this was their view. 
“Yes”, they replied. 
I asked them how this came about, and when they could not explain, I said: 
“There are, friends, certain devas called Unconscious. 
As soon as a perception arises in them, those devas fall from that realm ... ^i[remembering nothing (Sutta], 1, ^i[verse 2.31]) they think: 

^n46 ‘Now from non-being I have been brought to being.’ 
That, Reverend Sirs, is how it comes about that you teach that the beginning of things was due to chance.” 



And they said: 
“We have heard this, Reverend Gotama, as you have explained.” 

But I know the first beginning of things, and I know not only that, but what surpasses it in value. 



And I am not under the sway of what I know, and not being under its sway I have come to know for myself that quenching, by the realisation of which the Tathāgata cannot fall into perilous paths.

^n47 ‘And I, Bhaggava, who teach this and declare this am wrongly, vainly, lyingly and falsely accused by some ascetics and Brahmins who say: 
“The ascetic Gotama is on the wrong track,^f25 and so are his monks. 
He has declared that 
whoever has attained to the stage of deliverance called ‘the Beautiful’^f26 finds everything repulsive.” 
But I do not say this. 

What I say is that 
whenever anyone has attained to the stage of deliverance called “the Beautiful”, he knows that it is beautiful.’
‘Indeed, Lord, they are on the wrong track themselves who accuse the Lord and his monks of error. 
I am so delighted with the Lord that I think the Lord is able to teach me to attain and remain in the deliverance called “the Beautiful”.’
^n48 ‘It is hard for you, Bhaggava, holding different views, being of different inclinations and subject to different influences, following a different discipline and having had a different teacher, to attain and remain in the deliverance called “the Beautiful”. 
You must strive hard, putting your trust in me, Bhaggava.’
‘Lord, even if it is hard for me to attain and remain in the deliverance called “the Beautiful”, 
still I will place my trust in the Lord.’^f27 
Thus the Lord spoke, 
and Bhaggava the wanderer was delighted and rejoiced at the Lord’s words.

^ck#d25(^z1[Udumbarika-Sῑhanāda Sutta: The Great Lion’s Roar to the Udumbarikans] )^n49 THUS HAVE I HEARD. 
Once the Lord was staying in Rājagaha at the Vultures’ Peak. 
And at that time the wanderer Nigrodha^f28 was staying at the Udumbarikā lodging^f29 for wanderers, with a large company of some three thousand wanderers. 
And one morning early, the householder Sandhana came to Rājagaha in order to see the Lord. 
Then he thought: 
‘It is not the proper time to see the Blessed Lord, 
he is in retreat; 
it is not the proper time to see the meditating monks, 
they are in retreat. 
Perhaps I should go to the Udumbarikā lodging for wanderers and call on Nigrodha.’ 
And he did so.
^n50 And just then Nigrodha was sitting in the midst of a large crowd of wanderers who were all shouting and screaming and making a great clamour, and indulging in various kinds of unedifying conversation^f30 about 
kings, robbers, ministers, armies, dangers, war, food, drink, clothes, beds, garlands, perfumes, relatives, carriages, villages, towns and cities, countries, women, heroes, street- and well-gossip, talk of the departed, desultory chat, speculation about land and sea, talk of being and non-being.
^n51 Then Nigrodha saw Sandhāna approaching from a distance, 
and he called his followers to order, saying: 
‘Be quiet, gentlemen, don’t make a noise, gentlemen! 
The householder Sandhāna, a follower of the ascetic Gotama, is approaching. 
He is one of the number of white-robed householder followers of the ascetic Gotama in Rājagaha. 
And these good folk are fond of quiet, they are taught to be quiet and speak in praise of quiet. 
If he sees that this company is quiet, he will most likely want to come and visit us.’ 
At this the wanderers fell silent.
^n52 Then Sandhāna approached Nigrodha and exchanged courtesies with him, and then sat down to one side. 
Then he said: ‘Reverend sirs, the way the wanderers of another faith conduct themselves when they come together is one thing: 
they make a great clamour and indulge in all manner of unedifying conversation...

The Blessed Lord’s way is different : he seeks a lodging in the forest, in the depths of the jungle, free from noise, with little sound, far from the madding crowd, undisturbed by men, well fitted for seclusion.’
^n53 Then Nigrodha replied: 
‘Well now, householder, do you know whom the ascetic Gotama talks to? Whom does he converse with? From whom does he get his lucidity of wisdom? 
The ascetic Gotama’s wisdom is destroyed by the solitary life, he is unused to assemblies, he is no good at conversation, 
he is right out of touch. 
Just as bison^f31 circling around keep to the fringes, so it is with the ascetic Gotama. 




In fact, householder, if the ascetic Gotama were to come to this assembly, we would baffle him with a single question, we would knock him over like an empty pot.’
^n54 Now the Lord, with his divine-ear-faculty, purified and surpassing human range, heard this exchange between Sandhāna and Nigrodha. 
And, descending from the Vultures’ Peak, he came to the Peacocks’ Feeding Ground beside the Sumāgadha Tank, and walked up and down there in the open air. 
Then Nigrodha caught sight of him, 
and he called his company to order, saying: 
‘Gentlemen, he quiet, be less noisy! The ascetic Gotama is walking up and down beside the Sumāgadha Tank. 
He is fond of quiet, he speaks in praise of quiet. 
If he sees that this company is quiet, he will most likely want to come and visit us. 
If he does so, we will put this question to him: 
“Lord, what is this doctrine in which the Blessed Lord trains his disciples, and which those disciples whom he has so trained as to benefit from it recognise as their principal support, and the perfection of the holy life?”’ 
At this, the wanderers were silent.
^n55 Then the Lord approached Nigrodha, 
and Nigrodha said: 
‘Come, Blessed Lord, welcome, Blessed Lord! 
At last the Blessed Lord has gone out of his way to come here. 
Be seated, Lord, a seat is prepared.’ 
The Lord sat down on the prepared seat, 
and Nigrodha took a low stool and sat down to one side. 
Then the Lord said to him: 
‘Nigrodha, what was the subject of your conversation just now? What talk have I interrupted?’ 
Nigrodha replied: 
‘Lord, we saw the Blessed Lord walking up and down at the Peacocks’ Feeding Ground by the Sumāgadhā Tank, and we thought: 
“If the ascetic Gotama were to come here we could ask him this question: 
Lord, what is this doctrine in which the Blessed Lord trains his disciples, and which those disciples whom he has so trained as to benefit from it recognise as their principal support, and the perfection of the holy life?”’
‘Nigrodha, it is hard for you, holding different views, being of different inclinations and subject to different influences, following a different teacher, to understand the doctrine which I teach my disciples... Come on then, Nigrodha, ask me about your own teaching, about your extreme austerity. 
^n56 How are the conditions of austerity and self-mortification fulfilled, and how are they not fulfilled?’

At this the wanderers made a great commotion and noise, exclaiming: 

‘It is wonderful, it is marvellous how great are the powers of the ascetic Gotama in holding back with his own theories and in inviting others to discuss theirs!’
^n57 Silencing them, Nigrodha said: 
‘Lord, we teach the higher austerities, we regard them as essential, we adhere to them. 
Such being the case, what constitutes their fulfilment or non-fulfilment? ’ 
‘Suppose, Nigrodha, a self-mortifier goes naked, uses no polite restraints, licks his hands, does not come or stand still when requested. 
He does not accept food out of the pot or pan...(^i[as Sutta 8, verse 14).]
 


He wears coarse hemp or mixed material, shrouds from corpses, rags from the dust-heap ... 
He is a plucker-out of hair and beard, devoted to this practice; 


he is a covered-thorn man, 
making his bed on them, 

sleeping alone in a garment of wet mud, 
living in the open air, 
accepting whatever seat is offered, 

one who drinks no water and is addicted to the practice, 
or he dwells intent on the practice of going to bathe three times before evening. 
What do you think, Nigrodha, 
is the higher austerity thereby fulfilled, or not?’ 
‘Indeed, Lord, it is fulfilled.’ 
‘But, Nigrodha, I maintain that this higher austerity can be faulted in various ways.’
^n58 ‘In what way, Lord, do you maintain that it can be faulted ?’ 
‘Take the case, Nigrodha, of a self-mortifier who practises a certain austerity. 
As a result, he is pleased and satisfied at having attained his end. 
And this is a fault in that self-mortifier. 
Or else in so doing he elevates himself and disparages others. 

And this is a fault in that self-mortifier. 
Or else he has become intoxicated with conceit, infatuated and therefore careless. 

And this is a fault in that self-mortifier.
^n59 ‘Again, a self-mortifier practises a certain austerity, and this brings him gains, honours and fame. As a result, he is pleased and satisfied at having attained his end... 
Or else he elevates himself and disparages others ... Or else he becomes intoxicated with conceit, infatuated and therefore careless. 
And this is a fault in that self-mortifier. 
Again, a self-mortifier practises a certain austerity, and he divides his food into two heaps, saying: 
“This suits me, that doesn’t suit me!” 

And what does not suit him he eagerly rejects, while what suits him he eats up greedily, recklessly and passionately, not seeing the peril, with no thought for the consequences. 

And this is a fault in that self-mortifier. 
^n60 Again, a self-mortifier practises a certain austerity for the sake of gains, honours and fame, thinking: 





“Kings and their ministers will honour me, Khattiyas and Brahmins and householders, and religious teachers.” 
And this is a fault in that self-mortifier.
^n61 ‘Again, a self-mortifier disparages some ascetic or Brahmin, saying: 
“See how he lives in abundance, eating all sorts of things! 
Whether propagated from roots, from stems, from joings, from cuttings or fifthly from seeds,^f32 he chews them all up with that thunderbolt of a jaw of his, and they call him an ascetic!” 
And this is a fault in that self-mortifier. 
Or he sees another ascetic or Brahmin being made much of by families, being honoured and respected and worshipped, 
and he thinks: 
“They make much of that rich-liver, they honour him, respect him and worship him, whereas I who am a real ascetic and self-mortifier get no such treatment!” 
Thus he is envious and jealous because of those householders. 
And this is a fault in that self-mortifier.‘
^n62 Again, a self-mortifier sits in a prominent position. 
And this is a fault in that self-mortifier. 
Or he goes round ostentatiously ^f33 among the families, as if to say: 
“See, this is my way of renunciation!” 
And this is a fault in that self-mortifier. 
 Or he behaves in an underhand way. 
On being asked: “Do you approve of this?” although he does not approve he says: “I do”, 
or although he does approve he says: “I do not.” 
In this way he becomes a conscious liar. 
And this is a fault in that self-mortifier.
‘Again, a self-mortifier, when the Tathagata or a disciple of the Tathagata presents the Dhamma in a way that should command his assent, withholds that assent. 
And this is a fault in that self-mortifier. 
^n63 Or he is angry and bad-tempered. 
And this is a fault in that self-mortifier. 

Or he is mean and spiteful, 
envious and jealous, 
crafty and deceitful, 
obstinate and proud, 
with evil desires and under their sway, with wrong views and given to extremist opinions; 
he is tainted with worldliness, 
holding on firmly, unwilling to give up. 

And this is a fault in that self-mortifier. 
What do you think, Nigrodha? 
Are these things faults in the higher austerity, or not?’ 
‘Certainly they are, Lord. 
It could happen that a single self-mortifier was possessed of all these faults, 
not to speak of just one or the other.’
^n64 ‘Now, Nigrodha, take the case of a certain self-mortifier who practises a certain austerity. 
As a result, he is not pleased and satisfied at having attained his end. 
This being so, in this respect he is purified. 
Again, he does not elevate himself and disparage others... 



^n65 





^n66 







^n67 (^i[similarly with all examples in 10 — 11]). 






Thus he does not become a conscious liar. 
In this respect he is purified.
^n68 











‘Again, a self-mortifier, when the Tathagata or a disciple of the Tathagata presents the Dhamma in a way that should command his assent, gives his assent. 
In this respect he is purified. 
^n69 And he is not angry or bad-tempered. 
In this respect he is purified. 
And he is not mean and spiteful, 
envious and jealous, 
crafty and deceitful, 
obstinate and proud, 
he is without evil desires and not under their sway, 
without wrong views and not given to extremist opinions, 
he is not tainted with worldliness, does not hold on firmly and is not unwilling to give up. 

In this respect he is purified. 
What do you think, Nigrodha? 
Is the higher austerity purified by these things, or not?’ 
‘Certainly it is, Lord, it attains its peak there, penetrating to the pith.’ 
‘No, Nigrodha, it does not attain its peak there, penetrating to the pith. 
It has only reached the outer bark.’^f34
^n70 ‘Well then, Lord, how does austerity attain its peak, penetrating to the pith? 
It would be good if the Blessed Lord were to cause my austerity to attain its peak, to penetrate to the pith.’
‘Nigrodha, take the case of a self-mortifier who observes the fourfold restraint. 
And what is this? 
Here, a self-mortifier does not harm a living being, does not cause a living being to be harmed, does not approve of such harming; 
he does not take what is not given, or cause it to be taken, or approve of such taking; 
he does not tell a lie, or cause a lie to be told, or approve of such lying; 
he does not crave for sense-pleasures,^f35 cause others to do so, or approve of such craving. 
In this way, a self-mortifier observes the fourfold restraint. 
And through this restraint, through making this his austerity, 
he takes an upward course and does not fall back into lower things.
‘Then he finds a solitary lodging, at the root of a forest tree, in a mountain cave or gorge, a charnel-ground, a jungle-thicket, or in the open air on a heap of straw. 
Then, having eaten after his return from the alms-round, he sits down cross-legged, holding his body erect, having established mindfulness before him.^f36
 Abandoning hankering for the world, he dwells with a mind freed from such hankering, and his mind is purified of it. 
Abandoning ill-will and hatred, he dwells with a mind freed from them, and by compassionate love for the welfare of all living beings, his mind is purified of them. 
Abandoning sloth-and-torpor, ... by the perception of light,^f37 mindful and clearly aware, his mind is purified of sloth-and-torpor. 
Abandoning worry-and-flurry, ... and with an inwardly calmed heart his mind^f38 is purified of worry-and-flurry. 
Abandoning doubt, he dwells with doubt left behind, without uncertainty as to what things are wholesome, his mind purified of doubt.
^n71 ‘Having abandoned these five hindrances, and in order to weaken by insight the defilements^f39 of mind, 
he dwells, letting his mind, filled with loving-kindness, pervade one quarter, then a second, then a third, then a fourth. And so he continues to pervade the whole wide world, above, below, across and everywhere with a mind filled with loving-kindness, extensive, developed,^f40 measureless, free from hatred and ill-will. 
And he dwells, letting his mind, filled with compassion, ... 
with sympathetic joy, ... 
with equanimity, pervade one quarter,... extensive, developed, measureless, free from hatred and ill-will. 
What do you think, Nigrodha? 
Is the higher austerity purified by these things, or not?’ 
‘Certainly it is, Lord. It attains its peak there, penetrating to the pith.’ 
‘No, Nigrodha, it does not attain its peak there. 
It has only penetrated to the inner bark.^f41
^n72 ‘Well then, Lord, how does austerity attain its peak, penetrating to the pith? 
It would be good if the Blessed Lord were to cause my austerity to attain its peak, to penetrate to the pith.’
‘Nigrodha, take the case of a self-mortifier who observes the fourfold restraint... (^i[as verses 16-17]), free from hatred and ill-will. 









He recalls various past lives ... There my name was so-and-so,... my caste was so-and-so...(^i[as Sutta 1], ^i[verse 1.31]). I experienced such-and-such pleasant and painful conditions ...Having passed from there, I arose there... Thus he remembers various past lives, their conditions and details. 
What do you think, Nigrodha? 
Is the higher austerity purified by these things, or not?’ 
‘Certainly it is, Lord. It attains its peak there, penetrating to the pith.’ 
‘No, Nigrodha, it only reaches the fibres surrounding the pith.’^f42

^n73 ‘Well then, Lord, how does austerity reach its peak, penetrating to the pith? 
It would be good if the Blessed Lord were to cause my austerity to attain its peak, to penetrate to the pith.’ 
‘Well, Nigrodha, take the case of a self-mortifier who observes the fourfold restraint...





, free from hatred and ill-will... 

Thus he remembers various past lives, their conditions and details. 
And then, with the purified divine eye, he sees beings passing away and arising: base and noble, well favoured and ill-favoured, to happy and unhappy destinations as kamma directs them. 
What do you think, Nigrodha? 
Is the higher austerity purified by these things, or not?’ 
‘Certainly it is, Lord. It attains its peak there, penetrating to the pith.’^f43‘
^n74 So indeed it is, Nigrodha, that austerity is so purified as to reach its peak and penetrate to the pith. 
And so, Nigrodha, when you ask: 
“What, Lord, is this doctrine in which the Blessed Lord trains his disciples, and which those disciples whom he has so trained as to benefit from it recognise as their principal support, and the perfection of the holy life?” 
I say that it is by something more far-reaching and excellent that I train them, through which they... recognise as their principal support, and the perfection of the holy life.’
At this the wanderers made a great commotion and noise, exclaiming: 
‘We and our teacher are ruined! We know of nothing higher or more far-reaching than our teaching!’ 
^n75 And when the householder Sandhāna realised: 
‘These wanderers of other views are actually listening and attending to the Lord’s words, and inclining their minds to the higher wisdom, 
he said to Nigrodha: 
‘Reverend Nigrodha, you said to me: 
“Come now, householder, do you know whom the ascetic Gotama talks to? ... 
His wisdom is destroyed by the solitary life, he is no good at conversation, he is right out of touch...” 



So now that the Blessed Lord has come here, why don’t you baffle him with a single question and knock him over like an empty pot?’ 
And at these words Nigrodha was silent and upset, his shoulders drooped, he hung his head and sat there downcast and bewildered.
^n76 Seeing the state he was in, the Lord said: 
‘Is it true, Nigrodha, that you said that?’ 
‘Lord, it is true that I said that, foolishly, mistakenly, and wickedly.’ 
‘What do you think, Nigrodha? 
Have you ever heard it said by wanderers who were aged, venerable, the teachers of teachers, 
that those who in the past were Arahants, fully-enlightened Buddhas used to talk, when they came together, by shouting and screaming and making a great clamour, and indulging in unedifying conversation ... 

the way you and your teachers do? 
Or did they not say rather that those Blessed Ones sought lodging in the forest, in the depths of the jungle, free from noise, with little sound, far from the madding crowd, undisturbed by men, well-fitted for seclusion, just as I do now?’ 
‘Lord, I have heard it said that 
those who were Arahants, fully-enlightened Buddhas did not indulge in loud talk ... 
but sought lodging in the forest, ... 

just as the Blessed Lord does now.’ 
‘Nigrodha, you are an intelligent man of mature years. Did it never occur to you to think: 
“The Blessed Lord is enlightened and teaches a doctrine of enlightenment, he is self-restrained and teaches a doctrine of self-restraint, he is calm and teaches a doctrine of calm. He has gone beyond and teaches a doctrine of going beyond, he has gained Nibbāna and teaches a doctrine for the gaining of Nibbāna”?’
^n77 At this, Nigrodha said to the Lord: 
‘Transgression overcame me, Lord! Foolish, blind and evil as I was, that I spoke thus of the Lord. 
May the Lord accept my confession of this fault, that I may restrain myself in future!’^f44
 ‘Indeed, Nigrodha, transgression overcame you when, through folly, blindness and evil you spoke thus of me. 
But since you recognise the nature of your transgression and make amends as is right, we accept your confession. 
For, Nigrodha, it is a mark of progress in the discipline of the Noble Ones, if anyone recognises the nature of his transgression and makes amends as is right, restraining himself for the future.
‘But, Nigrodha, I tell you this: 
Let an intelligent man come to me who is sincere, honest and straightforward, and I will instruct him, I will teach him Dhamma. 
If he practises what he is taught, then within seven years he will attain in this life to that unequalled holy life and goal, for the sake of which young men of good family go forth from the household life into homelessness, by his own knowledge and realisation, and he will abide therein. 
Let alone seven years — 

in six years, 
five, 
four, 
three, 
two years, 
one year, ... 


seven months, 

six months, 
five, 
four, 
three, 
two months, 
one month, 
half a month. 
Let alone half a month — 

in seven days he can gain that goal.^f45
^n78 ‘Nigrodha, you may think: 
“The ascetic Gotama says this in order to get disciples.” 
But you should not regard it like that. 
Let him who is your teacher remain your teacher.^f46
 Or you may think: 
“He wants us to abandon our rules.” 
But you should not regard it like that. 
Let your rules remain as they are. 
Or you may think: 
“He wants us to abandon our way of life.” 
But you should not regard it like that. 
Let your way of life remain as it was. 
Or you may think: 
“He wants to establish us in the doing of things that according to our teaching are wrong, and are so considered among us.” 
But you should not regard it like that. 
Let those things you consider wrong continue to be so considered. 
Or you may think: 
“He wants to draw us away from things that according to our teaching are good, and are so considered among us.” 
But you should not regard it like that. 
Let whatever you consider right continue to be so considered. 
Nigrodha, I do not speak for any of these reasons ... 
‘There are, Nigrodha, unwholesome things that have not been abandoned, tainted, conducive to rebirth,^f47 fearful, productive of painful results in the future, associated with birth, decay and death. It is for the abandonment of these things that I teach Dhamma. 
If you practise accordingly, these tainted things will be abandoned, and the things that make for purification will develop and grow, and you will all attain to and dwell, in this very life, by your own insight and realisation, in the fullness of perfected wisdom.’
^n79 At these words the wanderers sat silent and upset, their shoulders drooped, they hung their heads and sat there downcast and bewildered, so possessed were their minds by Māra.^f48
 Then the Lord said: 
‘Every one of these foolish men is possessed by the evil one, 
so that not a single one of them thinks: 
“Let us now follow the holy life proclaimed by the ascetic Gotama, that we may learn it — for what do seven days matter?”’
 Then the Lord, having uttered his lion’s roar in the Udumbarika park, rose up in the air and alighted on the Vultures’ Peak. 
And the householder Sandhāna also returned to Rājagaha. ^f49

^ck#d26(^z1[Cakkavatti-Sῑhanāda Sutta: The Lion’s Roar on the Turning of the Wheel] )^n80 THUS HAVE I HEARD.^f50 
Once the Lord was staying among the Magadhans at Mātulā. 
Then he said: 
‘Monks!’ 
‘Lord’, they replied, 
and the Lord said:
‘Monks, be islands unto yourselves, be a refuge unto yourselves with no other refuge. 
Let the Dhamma be your island, let the Dhamma be your refuge, with no other refuge.^f51
 And how does a monk dwell as an island unto himself, as a refuge unto himself with no other refuge, with the Dhamma as his island, with the Dhamma as his refuge, with no other refuge? 
Here, a monk abides contemplating body as body,^f52 ardent, clearly aware and mindful, having put aside hankering and fretting for the world, he abides contemplating feelings as feelings, ... 
he abides contemplating mind as mind, ... 
he abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects, ardent, clearly aware and mindful, having put aside hankering and fretting for the world.
‘Keep to your own preserves,^f53 monks, to your ancestral haunts.^f54 If you do so, then Mara will find no lodgement, no foothold. 

It is just by the building-up of wholesome states that this merit increases.

^n81 ‘Once, monks, there was a wheel-turning monarch named Daḷhanemi, a righteous monarch of the law, conqueror of the four quarters, who had established the security of his realm and was possessed of the seven treasures. 
These are: 
the Wheel Treasure, the Elephant Treasure, the Horse Treasure, the Jewel Treasure, the Woman Treasure, the Householder Treasurer, and, as seventh, the Counsellor Treasure. 
He has more than a thousand sons who are heroes, of heroic stature, conquerors of the hostile army. 
He dwells having conquered this sea-girt land without stick or sword, by the law (^i[as Sutta 3, verse 1.5]).
^n82 ‘And, after many hundreds and thousands of years, King Daḷhanemi said to a certain man: 
“My good man, whenever you see that the sacred Wheel-Treasure has slipped from its position, report it to me.” 
“Yes, sire”, the man replied. 
And after many hundreds and thousands of years the man saw that the sacred Wheel-Treasure had slipped from its position. 
Seeing this, he reported the fact to the King. 
Then King Daḷhanemi sent for his eldest son, the crown prince, and said: 
“My son, the sacred Wheel-Treasure has slipped from its position. 
And I have heard say that 
when this happens to a wheel-turning monarch, he has not much longer to live. 
I have had my fill of human pleasures, now is the time to seek heavenly pleasures. 
You, my son, take over control of this ocean-bounded land. 
I will shave off my hair and beard, don yellow robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness.”
^n83  And, having installed his eldest son in due form as king, King Daḷhanemi shaved off his hair and beard, donned yellow robes, and went forth from the household life into homelessness. 
 And, seven days after the royal sage had gone forth, the sacred Wheel-Treasure vanished.
‘Then a certain man came to the anointed Khattiya King and said: 
“Sire, you should know that the sacred Wheel-Treasure has disappeared.” 
At this the King was grieved and felt sad. 
He went to the royal sage and told him the news. 

And the royal sage said to him: 
“My son, you should not grieve or feel sad at the disappearance of the Wheel-Treasure. The Wheel-Treasure is not an heirloom from your fathers. 
But now, my son, you must turn yourself into an Ariyan wheel-turner. ^f55 
And then it may come about that, if you perform the duties of an Ariyan wheel-turning monarch, on the fast-day of the fifteenth,^f56 when you have washed your head and gone up to the verandah on top of your palace for the fast-day, the sacred Wheel-Treasure will appear to you, thousand-spoked, complete with felloe, hub and all appurtenances.”
^n84 ‘“But what, sire, is the duty of an Ariyan wheel-turning monarch?” 
“It is this, my son: Yourself depending on the Dhamma, honouring it, revering it, cherishing it, doing homage to it and venerating it, having the Dhamma as your badge and banner, acknowledging the Dhamma as your master, you should establish guard, ward and protection according to Dhamma for your own household, your troops, your nobles and vassals, for Brahmins and householders, town and country folk, ascetics and Brahmins, for beasts and birds.^f57
 Let no crime^f58 prevail in your kingdom, 
and to those who are in need, give property. 
And whatever ascetics and Brahmins in your kingdom have renounced the life of sensual infatuation and are devoted to forbearance and gentleness, each one taming himself, each one calming himself and each one striving for the end of craving, from time to time you should go to them 
and consult them as to what is wholesome and what is unwholesome, that is blameworthy and what is blameless, what is to be followed and what is not to be followed, and what action will in the long run lead to harm and sorrow, and what to welfare and happiness. 
Having listened to them, you should avoid evil and do what is good.^f59 
That, my son, is the duty of an Ariyan wheel-turning monarch.’
^n85 , said the King, and he performed the duties of an Ariyan wheel-turning monarch. 
And as he did so, on the fast-day of the fifteenth, when he had washed his head and gone up to the verandah on top of his palace for the fast-day, 
the sacred Wheel-Treasure appeared to him, thousand-spoked, complete with felloe, hub and all appurtenances. 
Then the King thought: 
“I have heard that when a duly anointed Khattiya king sees such a wheel on the fast-day of the fifteenth, he will become a wheel-turning monarch. 
May I become such a monarch!”^f60
‘Then, rising from his seat, covering one shoulder with his robe, the King took a gold vessel in his left hand, sprinkled the Wheel with his right hand, and said: 
“May the noble Wheel-Treasure turn, may the noble Wheel-Treasure conquer!” 
The Wheel turned to the east, and the King followed it with his fourfold army. And in whatever country the Wheel stopped, the King took up residence with his fourfold army. 
And those who opposed him in the eastern region came and said: 
“Come, Your Majesty, welcome! We are yours, Your Majesty. Rule us, Your Majesty.” 
And the King said: 
“Do not take life. Do not take what is not given. Do not commit sexual misconduct. Do not tell lies. Do not drink strong drink. Be moderate in eating.”^f61
 And those who had opposed him in the eastern region became his subjects.
^n86 ‘Then the Wheel turned south, 
west, 
and north ... (as verse 6). 




Then the Wheel-Treasure, having conquered the lands from sea to sea, returned to the royal capital and stopped before the King’s palace as he was trying a case, as if to adorn the royal palace.
^n87 







^n88 ‘And a second wheel-turning monarch did likewise, 
and a third, 
a fourth, 
a fifth, 
a sixth, 
and a seventh king also ... 



told a man to see if the Wheel had slipped from its position (as verse 3). 
And seven days after the royal sage had gone forth the Wheel disappeared.
^n89 






^n90 ‘Then a man came to the King and said: 
“Sire, you should know that the sacred Wheel-Treasure has disappeared.” 
At this the King was grieved and felt sad. 
But he did not go to the royal sage and ask him about the duties of a wheel-turning monarch. 
Instead, he ruled the people according to his own ideas, 
and, being so ruled, the people did not prosper so well as they had done under the previous kings who had performed the duties of a wheel-turning monarch. 
Then the ministers, counsellors, treasury officials, guards and doorkeepers, and the chanters of mantras came to the King and said: 
“Sire, as long as you rule the people according to your own ideas, and differently from the way they were ruled before under previous wheel-turning monarchs, the people do not prosper so well. 
Sire, there are ministers ... in your realm, including ourselves, who have preserved the knowledge of how a wheel-turning monarch should rule. 
Ask us, Your Majesty, 
and we will tell you!”
^n91 ‘Then the King ordered all the ministers and others to come together, and he consulted them. 
And they explained to him the duties of a wheel-turning monarch. 
And, having listened to them, the King established guard and protection, but he did not give property to the needy, and as a result poverty became rife. 
With the spread of poverty, 
a man took what was not given, thus committing what was called theft. 
They arrested him, 
and brought him before the King, saying: 
“Your Majesty, this man took what was not given, which we call theft.” 
The King said to him: 
“Is it true that you took what was not given — which is called theft?” 
“It is, Your Majesty.” 
“Why?” 
“Your Majesty, I have nothing to live on.” 
Then the King gave the man some property, saying: 
“With this, my good man, you can keep yourself, support your mother and father, keep a wife and children, carry on a business and make gifts to ascetics and Brahmins, which will promote your spiritual welfare and lead to a happy rebirth with pleasant result in the heavenly sphere.” 
“Very good, Your Majesty”, replied the man.
‘And exactly the same thing happened with another man.











^n92 
‘Then people heard that the King was giving away property to those who took what was not given, 
and they thought: 
“Suppose we were to do likewise!” 
And then another man took what was not given, 
and they brought him before the King. 
The King asked him why he had done this, and he replied: 
“Your Majesty, I have nothing to live on.” 
Then the King thought: 
“If I give property to everybody who takes what is not given, this theft will increase more and more. 





I had better make an end of him, finish him off once for all, and cut his head off.” 
So he commanded his men: 
“Bind this man’s arms tightly behind him with a strong rope, shave his head closely, and lead him to the rough sound of a drum through the streets and squares and out through the southern gate, and there finish by inflicting the capital penalty and cutting off his head!” 
And they did so.
^n93 ‘Hearing about this, people thought: 
“Now let us get sharp swords made for us, and then we can take from anybody what is not given 〔which is called theft〕, 

we will make an end of them, finish them off once for all and cut off their heads.” 
So, having procured some sharp swords, they launched murderous assaults on villages, towns and cities, and went in for highway-robbery, 
killing their victims by cutting off their heads.
^n94 ‘Thus, from the not giving of property to the needy, poverty became rife, from the growth of poverty, the taking of what was not given increased, from the increase of theft, the use of weapons increased, from the increased use of weapons, the taking of life increased — and from the increase in the taking of life, people’s life-span decreased, their beauty decreased, and as a result of this decrease of life-span and beauty, 
the children of those whose life-span had been eighty thousand years lived for only forty thousand.
‘And a man of the generation that lived for forty thousand years took what was not given. 
He was brought before the King, 


who asked him: 
“Is it true that you took what was not given — what is called theft?” 
“No, Your Majesty”, he replied, thus telling a deliberate lie.
^n95 ‘Thus, from the not giving of property to the needy,... 
the taking of life increased, and from the taking of life, lying increased, from the increase in lying, people’s life-span decreased, their beauty decreased, and as a result, the children of those whose life-span had been forty thousand years lived for only twenty thousand. 
‘And a man of the generation that lived for twenty thousand years took what was not given. 
Another man denounced him to the King, saying: 
“Sire, such-and-such a man has taken what was not given”, thus speaking evil of another.^f62
^n96 ‘Thus, from the not giving of property to the needy,... 
the speaking evil of others increased, and in consequence, people’s life-span decreased, their beauty decreased, and as a result, the children of those whose life-span had been twenty thousand years lived only for ten thousand. 
‘And of the generation that lived for ten thousand years, some were beautiful, and some were ugly. 
And those who were ugly, being envious of those who were beautiful, committed adultery with others’ wives. 
^n97  ‘Thus, from the not giving of property to the needy,... 
sexual misconduct increased, and in consequence people’s life-span decreased, their beauty decreased, and as a result, the children of those whose life-span had been ten thousand years lived for only five thousand.
^n98 ‘And among the generation whose life-span was five thousand years, two things increased: 
harsh speech and idle chatter, 
in consequence of which people’s life-span decreased, their beauty decreased, 
and as a result, the children of those whose life-span had been five thousand years lived, some for two-and-a-half thousand years, and some for only two thousand.
^n99 ‘And among the generation whose life-span was two-and-a-half thousand years, covetousness and hatred increased, and in consequence people’s life-span decreased, their beauty decreased, and as a result, the children of those whose life-span had been two-and-a-half thousand years lived for only a thousand.


^n100  ‘Among the generation whose life-span was a thousand years, false opinions^f63 increased... 

and as a result, the children of those whose life-span had been a thousand years lived for only five hundred.
^n101  ‘And among the generation whose life-span was five hundred years, three things increased: 
incest, excessive greed and deviant practices^f64... 

and as a result, the children of those whose life-span had been five hundred years lived, some for two hundred and fifty years, some for only two hundred.
‘And among those whose life-span was two hundred and fifty years, these things increased: 
lack of respect for mother and father, for ascetics and Brahmins, and for the head of the clan.
^n102 ‘Thus, from the not giving of property to the needy,... 










lack of respect for mother and father, for ascetics and Brahmins, and for the head of the clan increased, 
and in consequence people’s life-span and beauty decreased, 
and the children of those whose life-span had been two-and-a-half centuries lived for only a hundred years.
^n103 ‘Monks, a time will come when the children of these people will have a life-span of ten years. 
And with them, girls will be marriageable at five years old. 
And with them, these flavours will disappear: 
ghee, butter, sesame-oil, molasses and salt. 
Among them, ^i[kudrūsa-]grain^f65 will be the chief food, just as rice and curry are today. 
And with them, the ten courses of moral conduct will completely disappear, and the ten courses of evil will prevail exceedingly: 
for those of a ten-year lifespan there will be no word for “moral”^f66
 so how can there be anyone who acts in a moral way? 
Those people who have no respect for mother or father, for ascetics and Brahmins, for the head of the clan, will be the ones who enjoy honour and prestige. 
Just as it is now the people who show respect for mother and father, for ascetics and Brahmins, for the head of the clan, who are praised and honoured, 
so it will be with those who do the opposite.

‘Among those of a ten-year life-span no account will be taken of mother or aunt, of mother’s sister-in-law, of teacher’s wife or of one’s father’s wives and so on — 
all will be promiscuous in the world like goats and sheep, fowl and pigs, dogs and jackals. 
Among them, fierce enmity will prevail one for another, fierce hatred, fierce anger and thoughts of killing, 
mother against child and child against mother, 
father against child and child against father, 
brother against brother, brother against sister, 
just as the hunter feels hatred for the beast he stalks... 




^n104 ‘And for those of a ten-year life-span, there will come to be a “sword-interval”^f67 of seven days, 
during which they will mistake one another for wild beasts. 
Sharp swords will appear in their hands and, 
thinking: “There is a wild beast!” 
they will take each other’s lives with those swords. But there will be some beings who will think: 
“Let us not kill or be killed by anyone! Let us make for some grassy thickets or jungle-recesses or clumps of trees, for rivers hard to ford or inaccessible mountains, and live on roots and fruits of the forest.” 
And this they will do for seven days. 
Then, at the end of the seven days, they will emerge from their hiding-places and rejoice together of one accord, saying: 
^missing
^n105 And then the thought will occur to those beings: 
“It is only because we became addicted to evil ways that we suffered this loss of our kindred, so let us now do good! 
What good things can we do? 
Let us abstain from the taking of life — that will be a good practice.” 
And so they will abstain from the taking of life, and, having undertaken this good thing, 
will practise it. 
And through having undertaken such wholesome things, they will increase in life-span and beauty. 
And the children of those whose life-span was ten years will live for twenty years.
‘Then it will occur to those beings: 
“It is through having taken to wholesome practices that we have increased in life-span and beauty, 
so let us perform still more wholesome practices. 

Let us refrain from taking what is not given, 
from sexual misconduct, 
from lying speech, 
from slander, 
from harsh speech, 
from idle chatter, 
from covetousness, 
from ill-will, 
from wrong views; 
let us abstain from three things: 
incest, excessive greed, and deviant practices; 
let us respect our mothers and fathers, ascetics and Brahmins, and the head of the clan, and let us persevere in these wholesome actions.”
‘And so they will do these things, 
and on account of this they will increase in life-span and in beauty. 
The children of those whose life-span is twenty years will live to be forty, 
their children will live to be eighty, 
their children to be a hundred and sixty, 
their children to be three hundred and twenty, 
their children to be six hundred and forty; 
the children of those whose life-span is six hundred and forty years will live for two thousand years, 
their children for four thousand, 
their children for eight thousand, 
and their children for twenty thousand. 
The children of those whose life-span is twenty thousand years will live to be forty thousand, 
and their children will attain to eighty thousand years.
‘Among the people with an eighty thousand-year lifespan, girls will become marriageable at five hundred. 
^n106  And such people will know only three kinds of disease: greed, fasting, and old age.^f68
This Jambudipa, like Avῑci,^f69 will be as thick with people as the jungle is thick with reeds and rushes. 
At that time the Vārānasi^f70 of today will be a royal city called Ketumatῑ, powerful and prosperous, crowded with people and well-supplied. 
In Jambudipa there will be eighty-four thousand cities headed by Ketumati as the royal capital.
‘And in the time of the people with an eighty thousand-year life-span, there will arise in the capital city of Ketumati a king called Sankha, a wheel-turning monarch, a righteous monarch of the law, conqueror of the four quarters... (as verse 2).





^n107 ‘And in that time of the people with an eighty thousand-year life-span, there will arise in the world a Blessed Lord, an Arahant fully-enlightened Buddha named Metteyya,^f71 endowed with wisdom and conduct, a Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed, 
just as I am now. 
He will thoroughly know by his own super-knowledge, and proclaim, this universe with its devas and maras and Brahmas, its ascetics and Brahmins, and this generation with its princes and people, just as I do now. 
He will teach the Dhamma, lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, lovely in its ending, in the spirit and in the letter, and proclaim, just as I do now, the holy life in its fullness and purity. 

He will be attended by a company of thousands of monks, just as I am attended by a company of hundreds.
^n108 ‘Then King Sankha will re-erect the palace once built by King Mahā-Panāda^f72 and, 
having lived in it, will give it up and present it to the ascetics and Brahmins, the beggars, the wayfarers, the destitute. Then, shaving off hair and beard, he will don yellow robes and go forth from the household life into homelessness under the supreme Buddha Metteyya. 
Having gone forth, he will remain alone, in seclusion, ardent, eager and resolute, and before long he will have attained in this very life, by his own super-knowledge and resolution, that unequalled goal of the holy life, for the sake of which young men of good family go forth from the household life into homelessness, and will abide therein.
^n109 ‘Monks, be islands unto yourselves, be a refuge unto yourselves with no other refuge. 
Let the Dhamma be your island, let the Dhamma be your refuge with no other refuge. 
And how does a monk dwell as an island unto himself...? 
Here, a monk abides contemplating body as body, ardent, clearly aware and mindful, having put aside hankering and fretting for the world, he abides contemplating feelings as feelings, ... 
he abides contemplating mind as mind, ... 
he abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects, ardent, clearly aware and mindful, having put aside hankering and fretting for the world.

^n110 ‘Keep to your own preserves, monks, to your ancestral haunts. 
If you do so, your life-span will increase, your beauty will increase, your happiness will increase, your wealth will increase, your power will increase. 
‘And what is length of life for a monk? 
Here, a monk develops the road to power which is concentration of intention accompanied by effort of will, the road to power which is concentration of energy..., 
the road to power which is concentration of consciousness..., 

the road to power which is concentration of investigation accompanied by effort of will.^f73 
By frequently practising these four roads to power he can, if he wishes, live for a full century,^f74 or the remaining part of a century. 
That is what I call length of life for a monk.
‘And what is beauty for a monk? 
Here, a monk practises right conduct, is restrained according to the discipline, is perfect in behaviour and habits, sees danger in the slightest fault, and trains in the rules of training he has undertaken. 
That is beauty for a monk.
‘And what is happiness for a monk? 
Here, a monk, detached from sense-desires ... enters the first jhāna, ... 
(as ^i[Sutta 22], verse 21), the second, 
third, 
fourth jhāna, ... 
purified by equanimity and mindfulness. 
That is happiness for a monk.
‘And what is wealth for a monk? Here, a monk, with his heart filled with loving-kindness, dwells suffusing one quarter, the second, the third, the fourth. Thus he dwells suffusing the whole world, upwards, downwards, across — everywhere, always with a mind filled with loving-kindness, abundant, unbounded, without hate or ill-will. 
Then, with his heart filled with compassion,... 
with his heart filled with sympathetic joy, ... 
with his heart filled with equanimity,... he dwells suffusing the whole world, upwards, downwards, across, everywhere, always with a mind filled with equanimity, abundant, unbounded, without hate or ill-will.^f75
 That is wealth for a monk.
‘And what is power for a monk? 
Here, a monk, by the destruction of the corruptions., enters into and abides in that corruptionless liberation of heart and liberation by wisdom which he has attained, in this very life, by his own super-knowledge and realisation. 
That is power for a monk.
‘Monks, I do not consider any power^f76 so hard to conquer as the power of Māra. 
It is just by this building-up of wholesome states that this merit increases.’^f77
 Thus the Lord spoke, 
and the monks were delighted and rejoiced at his words.

^ck#d27(^z1[Aggañña Sutta: On Knowledge of Beginnings] )^n111 THUS HAVE I HEARD.^f78 
Once the Lord was staying at Savatthi, at the mansion of Migara’s mother^f79 in the East Park. 
And at that time Vasettha and Bhāradvāja^f80 were living among the monks, hoping to become monks themselves. 
And in the evening, the Lord rose from his secluded meditation and came out of the mansion, and started walking up and down in its shade.
^n112 Vasettha noticed this, and he said to Bhāradvāja: 
‘Friend Bharadvaja, 
the Lord has come out and is walking up and down. 
Let us approach him. 
We might be fortunate enough to hear a talk on Dhamma from the Lord himself.’ 
‘Yes, indeed’, said Bharadvaja, 
^n113 so they went up to the Lord, saluted him, and fell into step with him.
Then the Lord said to Vasettha: 
‘Vāseṭṭha,^f81 you two are Brahmins born and bred, and you have gone forth from the household life into homelessness from Brahmin families. Do not the Brahmins revile and abuse you?’ 
‘Indeed, Lord, the Brahmins do revile and abuse us. They don’t hold back with their usual flood of reproaches.’ 
‘Well, Vasettha, what kind of reproaches do they fling at you?’ 
‘Lord, what the Brahmins say is this: 
“The Brahmin caste^f82 is the highest caste, other castes are base; 
the Brahmin caste is fair, other castes are dark; 
Brahmins are purified, non-Brahmins are not, 
the Brahmins are the true children of Brahmā,^f83 born from his mouth, born of Brahma, created by Brahma, heirs of Brahma. 
And you, you have deserted the highest class and gone over to the base class of shaveling petty ascetics, servants, dark fellows born of Brahmā’s foot!^f84
 It’s not right, it’s not proper for you to mix with such people!” 
That is the way the Brahmins abuse us, Lord.’ 
^n114 ‘Then, Vasettha, the Brahmins have forgotten their ancient tradition when they say that. 




Because we can see Brahmin women, the wives of Brahmins, who menstruate and become pregnant, have babies and give suck. 
And yet these womb-born Brahmins talk about being born from Brahma’s mouth ... 
These Brahmins misrepresent Brahma, tell lies and earn much demerit.




^n115 ‘There are, Vasettha, these four castes: 
the Khattiyas, the Brahmins, the merchants and the artisans.^f85
 And sometimes a Khattiya takes life, takes what is not given, commits sexual misconduct, tells lies, indulges in slander, harsh speech or idle chatter, is grasping, malicious, or of wrong views. 
Thus such things as are immoral and considered so, blameworthy and considered so, to be avoided and considered so, ways unbefitting an Ariyan and considered so, black with black result^f86 and blamed by the wise, are sometimes to be found among the Khattiyas, and the same applies to Brahmins, merchants and artisans.
‘Sometimes, too, a Khattiya refrains from taking life,... is not grasping, malicious, or of wrong views. 







Thus such things as are moral and considered so, blameless and considered so, to be followed and considered so, ways befitting an Ariyan and considered so, bright with bright results and praised by the wise, are sometimes to be found among the Khattiyas, and likewise among Brahmins, 
merchants 
and artisans.



^n116 ‘Now since both dark and bright qualities, which are blamed and praised by the wise, are scattered indiscriminately among the four castes, 




the wise do not recognise the claim about the Brahmin caste being the highest. 
Why is that? 
Because, Vasettha, anyone from the four castes who becomes a monk, an Arahant who has destroyed the corruptions, who has lived the life, done what had to be done, laid down the burden,^f87 reached the highest goal, destroyed the fetter of becoming, and become emancipated through super-knowledge — he is proclaimed supreme by virtue of Dhamma and not of non-Dhamma.
Dhamma’s the best thing for people In this life and the next as well.
^n117 ‘This illustration will make clear to you how Dhamma is best in this world and in the next. 
King Pasenadi of Kosala knows: 
“The ascetic Gotama has gone forth from the neighbouring clan of the Sakyans.” 
Now the Sakyans are vassals of the King of Kosala. 
They offer him humble service and salute him, rise and do him homage and pay him fitting service. 
And, just as the Sakyans offer the King humble service..., so likewise does the King offer humble service to the Tathāgata, ^f88 thinking: “If the ascetic Gotama is well-born, I am ill-born; 
if the ascetic Gotama is strong, I am weak; 
if the ascetic Gotama is pleasant to look at, I am ill-favoured; 
if the ascetic Gotama is influential, I am of little influence.” 
Now it is because of honouring the Dhamma, making much of the Dhamma, esteeming the Dhamma, doing reverent homage to the Dhamma that King Pasenadi does humble service to the Tathagata and pays him fitting service:
Dhamma’s the best thing for people In this life and the next as well.
^n118 ‘Vasettha, all of you, though of different birth, name, clan and family, who have gone forth from the household life into homelessness, 
if you are asked who you are, should reply: “We are ascetics, followers of the Sakyan.”^f89 
He whose faith in the Tathagata is settled, rooted, established, solid, unshakeable by any ascetic or Brahmin, any deva or mara or Brahma or anyone in the world, can truly say: 
“I am a true son of Blessed Lord, born of his mouth, born of Dhamma, created by Dhamma, an heir of Dhamma.” 
Why is that? 
Because, Vasettha, this designates the Tathagata: “The Body of Dhamma”,^f90 that is, “The Body of Brahma”,^f91 or “Become Dhamma”, that is, “Become Brahma”.^f92
^n119 ‘There comes a time, Vasettha, when, sooner or later after a long period, this world contracts.^f93 
At a time of contraction, beings are mostly born in the Abhassara Brahma world. 
And there they dwell, mind-made, feeding on delight, self-luminous, moving through the air, glorious — and they stay like that for a very long time. 
But sooner or later, after a very long period, this world begins to expand again. 
At a time of expansion, the beings from the Abhassara Brahma world, having passed away from there, are mostly reborn in this world. 
Here they dwell, mind-made, feeding on delight, self-luminous, moving through the air, glorious^f94 — and they stay like that for a very long time.
^n120 ‘At that period, Vāseṭṭha, there was just one mass of water, and all was darkness, blinding darkness. 
Neither moon nor sun appeared, no constellations or stars appeared, night and day were not distinguished, nor months and fortnights, no years or seasons, and no male and female, beings being reckoned just as beings.^f95
 And sooner or later, after a very long period of time, savoury earth^f96 spread itself over the waters where those beings were. 
It looked just like the skin that forms itself over hot milk as it cools. 

It was endowed with colour, smell and taste. 
It was the colour of fine ghee or butter, and it was very sweet, like pure wild honey.

‘Then some being of a greedy nature said: 
“I say, what can this be?” and tasted the savoury earth on its finger. 
In so doing, it became taken with the flavour, and craving arose in it.^f97
Then other beings, taking their cue from that one, also tasted the stuff with their fingers. 
They too were taken with the flavour, and craving arose in them. 
^n121  So they set to with their hands, breaking off pieces of the stuff in order to eat it. 
And the result of this was that 
their self-luminance disappeared. 
And as a result of the disappearance of their self-luminance, the moon and the sun appeared, 

night and day were distinguished, 
months and fortnights appeared, 
and the year and its seasons. 
To that extent the world re-evolved.
^n122 ‘And those beings continued for a very long time feasting on this savoury earth, feeding on it and being nourished by it. 
And as they did so, their bodies became coarser,^f98 and a difference in looks developed among them. 
Some beings became good-looking, others ugly. 
And the good-looking ones despised the others, saying: 
“We are better-looking than they are.” 
And because they became arrogant and conceited about their looks, the savoury earth disappeared. 
At this they came together and lamented, crying: 

“Oh that flavour! Oh that flavour!” 
And so nowadays when people say: 
“Oh that flavour!” 
when they get something nice, they are repeating an ancient saying without realising it.
^n123 ‘And then, when the savoury earth had disappeared, a fungus^f99 cropped up, 
in the manner of a mushroom. 
It was of a good colour, smell, and taste. 
It was the colour of fine ghee or butter, and it was very sweet, like pure wild honey. 
And those beings set to and ate the fungus. 
And this lasted for a very long time. 
And as they continued to feed on the fungus, so their bodies became coarser still, and the difference in their looks increased still more. 
And the good-looking ones despised the others ... 


And because they became arrogant and conceited about their looks, the sweet fungus disappeared. 
^n124 Next, creepers appeared, shooting up like bamboo...
, and they too were very sweet, like pure wild honey.
 ‘And those beings set to and fed on those creepers. 
And as they did so, their bodies became even coarser, and the difference in their looks increased still more... 





And they became still more arrogant, and so the creepers disappeared too. 
At this they came together and lamented, crying: 
“Alas, our creeper’s gone! What have we lost!” 
And so now today when people, on being asked why they are upset, say: 
“Oh, what have we lost!” 
they are repeating an ancient saying without realising it.
^n125 ‘And then, after the creepers had disappeared, rice appeared in open spaces,^f100 free from powder and from husks, fragrant and clean-grained.^f101
 And what they had taken in the evening for supper had grown again and was ripe in the morning, and what they had taken in the morning for breakfast was ripe again by evening, with no sign of reaping. 
And these beings set to and fed on this rice, and this lasted for a very long time. 
And as they did so, their bodies became coarser still, and the difference in their looks became even greater. 
And the females developed female sex-organs,^f102 and the males developed male organs. 
^n126 Owing to this excessive preoccupation with each other, passion was aroused, and their bodies burnt with lust. 

And later, because of this burning, 
they indulged in sexual activity.^f103
 But those who saw them indulging threw dust, ashes or cow-dung at them, crying: 
“Die, you filthy beast! 
How can one being do such things to another!” 
Just as today, in some districts, when a daughter-in-law is led out, some people throw dirt at her, some ashes, and some cow-dung, 
without realising that they are repeating an ancient observance. 
^n127 What was considered bad form in those days is now considered good form.^f104
 ‘And those beings who in those days indulged in sex were not allowed into a village or town for one or two months. 
Accordingly those who indulged for an excessively long period in such immoral practices began to build themselves dwellings 
so as to indulge under cover.^f105
‘Now it occurred to one of those beings who was inclined to laziness: 
“Well now, why should I be bothered to gather rice in the evening for supper and in the morning for breakfast? 
Why shouldn’t I gather it all at once for both meals?” 
And he did so. 
Then another one came to him and said: 
“Come on, let’s go rice-gathering.” 
“No need, my friend, I’ve gathered enough for both meals.” 
Then the other, following his example, gathered enough rice for two days at a time, saying: “That should be about enough.” 
Then another being came and said to that second one: 
“Come on, let’s go rice-gathering.” 
“No need, my friend, I’ve gathered enough for two days.” 
(^i[The same for 4, then 8, days]). 




However, when those beings made a store of rice and lived on that, 
husk-powder and husk began to envelop the grain, 
and where it was reaped it did not grow again, and the cut place showed, and the rice grew in separate clusters.
^n128 ‘And then those beings came together lamenting: 
“Wicked ways have become rife among us: 
at first we were mind-made, feeding on delight... (^i[all events repeated down to the latest development, each fresh change being said to be due to] ‘wicked and unwholesome ways’)... 






















and the rice grows in separate clusters. 
So now let us divide up the rice into fields with boundaries.” 
So they did so.
^n129 ‘Then, Vāseṭṭha, one greedy-natured being, while watching over his own plot, took another plot that was not given to him, and enjoyed the fruits of it. 
So they seized hold of him and said: 
“You’ve done a wicked thing, taking another’s plot like that! 
Don’t ever do such a thing again!” 
“I won’t”, he said, but he did the same thing 
a second and 
a third time. 



Again he was seized and rebuked, and some hit him with their fists, some with stones, and some with sticks. 
And in this way, Vasettha, taking what was not given, and censuring, and lying, and punishment, took their origin.
^n130 ‘Then those beings came together and lamented the arising of these evil things among them: 
taking what was not given, censuring, lying and punishment. And they thought: 
“Suppose we were to appoint a certain being who would show anger where anger was due, censure those who deserved it, and banish those who deserved banishment! 
And in return, we would grant him a share of the rice.” 
So they went to the one among them who was the handsomest, the best-looking, the most pleasant and capable, and asked him to do this for them in return for a share of the rice, and he agreed.




^n131 “‘The People’s Choice” is the meaning of Mahā-Sammata, ^f106 which is the first regular title^f107 to be introduced. 
“Lord Of The Fields” is the meaning of Khattiya,^f108 the second such title. 
And “He Gladdens Others With Dhamma” is the meaning of Raja,^f109 the third title to be introduced. 
This, then, Vāseṭṭha, is the origin of the class of Khattiyas, in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them. They originated among these very same beings, like ourselves, no different, and in accordance with Dhamma, not otherwise.
Dhamma’s the best thing for people In this life and the next as well.
^n132 ‘Then some of these beings thought: 
“Evil things have appeared among beings, such as taking what is not given, censuring, lying, punishment and banishment. 
We ought to put aside evil and unwholesome things.” 
And they did so. 
“They Put Aside^f110 Evil And Uwholesome Things” 
is the meaning of Brahmin,^f111 which is the first regular title to be introduced for such people. They made leaf-huts in forest places and meditated in them. With the smoking fire gone out, with pestle cast aside, gathering alms for their evening and morning meals, they went away to a village, town or royal city to seek their food, 
and then they returned to their leaf-huts to meditate. 
People saw this and noted how they meditated. 
“They Meditate”^f112 is the meaning of Jhayaka,^f113 which is the second regular title to be introduced.‘However, some of those beings, not being able to meditate in leaf-huts, settled around towns and villages and compiled books.^f114 




People saw them doing this and not meditating. 
“Now These Do Not Meditate”^f115 is the meaning of Ajjhāyaka, ^f116 which is the third regular title to be introduced. 
At that time it was regarded as a low designation, but now it is the higher. 
This, then, Vāseṭṭha, is the origin of the class of Brahmins in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them. Their origin was from among these very same beings, like themselves, no different, and in accordance with Dhamma, not otherwise.
Dhamma’s the best thing for people In this life and the next as well.
^n133 ‘And then, Vāseṭṭha, some of those beings, having paired off,^f117 adopted various trades, 
and this “Various”^f118 is the meaning of Vessa, which came to be the regular title for such people. 
This, then, is the origin of the class of Vessas, in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them. 
Their origin was from among these very same beings...
^n134 ‘And then, Vāseṭṭha, those beings that remained went in for hunting. 
“They Are Base Who Live By The Chase”, and that is the meaning of Sudda,^f119 which came to be the regular title for such people. 
This, then, is the origin of the class of Suddas^f120 in accordance with the ancient titles that were introduced for them. 
Their origin was from among these very same beings...
^n135 ‘And then, Vāseṭṭha, it came about that some Khattiya, dissatisfied with his own Dhamma,^f121 went forth from the household life into homelessness, thinking: 




“I will become an ascetic.” 
And a Brahmin did likewise, a Vessa did likewise, and so did a Sudda. And from these four classes the class of ascetics came into existence. Their origin was from among these very same beings, like themselves, no different, and in accordance with Dhamma, not otherwise.
Dhamma’s the best thing for people In this life and the next as well.
^n136 ‘And, Vāseṭṭha, a Khattiya who has led a bad life in body, speech and thought, and who has wrong view will, in consequence of such wrong views and deeds, at the breaking-up of the body after death, be reborn in a state of loss, an ill fate, the downfall, the hell-state. 







So too will a Brahmin, a Vessa or a Sudda.
‘Likewise, a Khattiya who has led a good life in body, speech and thought, and who has right view will, in consequence of such right view and deeds, at the breaking-up of the body after death, be reborn in a good destiny, in a heaven-state. So too will a Brahmin, a Vessa or a Sudda.
^n137 ‘And a Khattiya who has performed deeds of both kinds in body, speech and thought, and whose view is mixed will, in consequence of such mixed views and deeds, at the breaking-up of the body after death, experience both pleasure and pain. 



So too will a Brahmin, a Vessa or a Sudda.
^n138 ‘And a Khattiya who is restrained in body, speech and thought, and who has developed the seven requisites of enlightenment, ^f122 will attain to Parinibbana^f123 in this very life. 



So too will a Brahmin, a Vessa or a Sudda.
^n139 ‘And, Vasettha, whoever of these four castes, as a monk, becomes an Arahant who has destroyed the corruptions, done what had to be done, laid down the burden, attained to the highest goal, completely destroyed the fetter of becoming, and become liberated by the highest insight, he is declared to be chief among them in accordance with Dhamma, and not otherwise. 
Dhamma’s the best thing for people In this life and the next as well. 
^n140 ‘Vasettha, it was Brahma Sanankumara who spoke this verse:
“The Khattiya’s best among those 
who value clan; 
He with knowledge 
and conduct is best of gods and men.”
This verse was rightly sung, not wrongly, rightly spoken, not wrongly, connected with profit, not unconnected. 
I too say, Vasettha:
“The Khattiya’s best among those 
who value clan; 
He with knowledge 
and conduct is best of gods and men.”’
Thus the Lord spoke, 
and Vasettha and Bharadvaja were derighted and rejoiced at his words.

^ck#d28(^z1[Sampasādanīya Sutta: Serene Faith] )^n141 THUS HAVE I HEARD. 
Once the Lord was styaing at Nālandā in Pāvārika’s mango-grove. 
And the Venerable Sāriputta came to see the Lord, saluted him, sat down to one side, and said:^f124
 ‘It is clear to me, Lord, that there never has been, never will be and is not now another ascetic or Brahmin who is better or more enlightened than the Lord.’
^n142 ‘You have spoken boldly with a bull’s voice, Sāriputta, you have roared the lion’s roar of certainty. 
How is this? 

Have all the Arahant Buddhas of the past appeared to you, and were the minds of all those Lords open to you, so as to say: 
“These Lords were of such virtue, such was their teaching, such their wisdom, such their way, such their liberation”?’ 
‘No, Lord.’ 
‘And have you perceived all the Arahant Buddhas who will appear in the future?’ 

‘No, Lord.’ 
‘Well then, Sāriputta, you know me as the Arahant Buddha, and do you know: 
“The Lord is of such virtue, such his teaching, such his wisdom, such his way, such his liberation”?’ 
‘No, Lord.’ 
‘So, Sāriputta, you do not have knowledge of the minds of the Buddhas of the past, the future or the present. 
Then, Sāriputta,have you not spoken boldly with a bull’s voice and roared the lion’s roar of certainty with your declaration?’

^n143 ‘Lord, the minds of the Arahant Buddhas of the past, future and present are not open to me. 
But I know the drift of the Dhamma. 
Lord, it is as if there were a royal frontier city, with mighty bastions and a mighty encircling wall in which was a single gate, 
at which was a gatekeeper, wise, skilled and clever, who kept out strangers and let in those he knew. 
And he, constantly patrolling and following along a path, might not see the joins and clefts in the bastion, even such as a cat might creep through. 
But whatever larger creatures entered or left the city, must all go through this very gate. 

And it seems to me, Lord, that the drift of the Dhamma is the same. 
All those Arahant Buddhas of the past attained to supreme enlightenment by abandoning the five hindrances, defilements of mind which weaken understanding, having firmly established the four foundations of mindfulness in their minds, and realised the seven factors of enlightenment as they really are. 
All the Arahant Buddhas of the future will do likewise, and you, Lord, who are now the Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, have done the same.‘So I came once to the Blessed Lord to listen to Dhamma. 
And the Blessed Lord taught me Dhamma most excellently and perfectly, contrasting the dark with the light. 
^n144 And as he did so, 

I gained insight into that Dhamma, and from among the various things I established one in particular, which was serene confidence^f125 in the Teacher, 
that the Blessed Lord is a fully-enlightened Buddha, that the Dhamma is well taught by the Blessed Lord, and that the order of monks is well-trained.
^n145 ‘Also, lord, the Blessed Lord’s way of teaching Dhamma in regard to the wholesome factors is unsurpassed, 
that is to say: 
the four foundations of mindfulness, the four right efforts, the four roads to power, the five spiritual faculties, the five mental powers, the seven factors of enlightenment, the Noble Eightfold Path.^f126
 By these a monk, through the destruction of the corruptions, can in this very life, by his own super-knowledge, realise and attain the corruption-free liberation of heart and liberation by wisdom, and abide therein. 
This is the unsurpassed teaching in regard to the wholesome factors. 
This the Blessed Lord fully comprehends, and beyond it lies nothing further to be comprehended; and in such understanding there is no other ascetic or Brahmin who is greater or more enlightened than the Blessed Lord, as regards the wholesome factors.
^n146 ‘Also unsurpassed is the Blessed Lord’s way of teaching Dhamma in regard to the elucidation of the sense-spheres: 
there are the six internal and external sense-bases:^f127
 eye and visible objects, ear and sounds, nose and smells, tongue and tastes, body and tactiles, mind and mind-objects. 
This is the unsurpassed teaching in regard to the sense-spheres ...

^n147 ‘Also unsurpassed is the Blessed Lord’s way of teaching Dhamma in regard to the modes of rebirth 
in four ways: 
thus, one descends into the mother’s womb unknowing,^f128 stays there unknowing, and leaves it unknowing. That is the first way. 
Or, one enters the womb knowing, stays there unknowing, and leaves it unknowing. That is the second way. 
Or, one enters the womb knowing, stays there knowing, and leaves it unknowing. That is the third way. 
Or, one enters the womb knowing, stays there knowing, and leaves it knowing. That is the fourth way. 
This is the unsurpassed teaching in regard to the modes of rebirth...
^n148 ‘Also unsurpassed is the Blessed Lord’s way of teaching Dhamma in regard to the telling of thoughts^f129 
in four ways. 
Thus, one tells by a visible sign, saying: 
“This is what you think, this is in your mind, your thought is like this.” 
And however much one declares, it is so and not otherwise. 
That is the first way. 
Or, one tells not by a visible sign, but through hearing a sound made by humans, non-humans,^f130 or devas ...


That is the second way. 
Or one tells not by a sound uttered, but by applying one’s mind and attending to something conveyed by sound ... 


That is the third way. 
Or one tells, not by any of these means, when one has attained a state of mental concentration without thinking and pondering, ^f131 by divining another’s thoughts in one’s mind, and one says: 
“As far as so-and-so’s mind-force is directed, so his thoughts will turn to that thing.” 
And however much one declares, it is so and not otherwise. 
That is the fourth way. 
This is the unsurpassed teaching in regard to the telling of thoughts in four ways...
^n149 ‘Also unsurpassed is the Blessed Lord’s way of teaching Dhamma in regard to the attainment of vision,^f132 
in four ways. 
Here, some ascetic or Brahmin, by means of ardour, endeavour, application, vigilance and due attention, reaches such a level of concentration that he considers just this body — upwards from the soles of the feet and downwards from the crown of the head, enclosed by the skin and full of manifold impurities: 
“In this body there are head-hairs, body-hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, sinews, bones, bone-marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, pleura, spleen, lungs, mesentery, bowels, stomach, excrement, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, tallow, saliva, snot, synovic fluid, urine.” ^i[(as Sutta 22, verse]5^i[)] 
That is the first attainment of vision. 
Again, having done this and gone further, he contemplates the bones covered with skin, flesh and blood. 


This is the second attainment. 
Again, having done this and gone further, he comes to know the unbroken stream of human consciousness as established both in this world and in the next.^f133



 That is the third attainment. 
Again, having done this and gone still further, he comes to know the unbroken stream of human consciousness that is not established either in this world or in the next.^f134
 


That is the fourth attainment of vision. 
This is the unsurpassed teaching in regard to the attainments of vision...
^n150 ‘Also unsurpassed is the Blessed Lord’s way of teaching Dhamma in regard to the designation of individuals.^f135 
There are these seven types: 
the Both-Ways-Liberated,^f136 the Wisdom-Liberated, ^f137 the Body-Witness,^f138 the Vision-Attainer,^f139 the Faith-Liberated,^f140 the Dhamma-Devotee,^f141 the Faith-Devotee. ^f142
 This is the unsurpassed teaching in regard to the designation of individuals...
^n151 ‘Also unsurpassed is the Blessed Lord’s way of teaching Dhamma in regard to the exertions.^f143 
There are these seven factors of enlightenment: mindfulness, investigation of states, energy, delight, tranquillity, concentration and equanimity. 
This is the unsurpassed teaching in regard to the exertions...
^n152 ‘Also unsurpassed in the Blessed Lord’s way of teaching Dhamma in regard to the modes of progress,^f144 which are four: 
painful progress with slow comprehension, 
painful progress with quick comprehension, 
pleasant progress with slow comprehension, 
pleasant progress with quick comprehension. 
In the case of painful progress with slow comprehension, progress is considered poor on account of both painfulness and slowness. 
In the case of painful progress with quick comprehension, progress is considered poor on account of painfulness. 
In the case of pleasant progress with slow comprehension, progress is considered poor on account of slowness. 
In the case of pleasant progress with quick comprehension, progress is considered excellent on account of both pleasantness and quick comprehension. 
This is the unsurpassed teaching in regard to the modes of progress...
^n153 ‘Also unsurpassed is the Blessed Lord’s way of teaching Dhamma in regard to proper conduct in speech: 
how one should avoid not only any speech involving lying, but also speech that is divisive ^f145 or sneeringly triumphant,^f146 
but should use wise words, words to be treasured, words in season. 
This is the unsurpassed teaching in regard to proper conduct in speech...
‘Also unsurpassed is the Blessed Lord’s way of teaching Dhamma in regard to a person’s proper ethical conduct. 
One should be truthful and faithful, not using deception, patter, hinting or belittling,^f147 not always on the make for further gains, but with sense-doors guarded, abstemious, a peace-maker, given to watchfulness, active, strenuous in effort, a meditator,^f148 mindful, of fitting conversation, steady-going,^f149 resolute^f150 and sensible,^f151 not hankering after sense-pleasures but mindful and prudent. 
This is the unsurpassed teaching in regard to a person’s proper ethical conduct...
^n154 ‘Also unsurpassed is the Blessed Lord’s way of teaching Dhamma in regard to modes of receptivity to instruction, 
of which there are four: 
The Blessed Lord knows by his own skilled observation:^f152
 “That one will, by following instructions, by the complete destruction of three fetters, become a Stream-Winner, no more subject to rebirth in lower worlds, firmly established, destined for full enlightenment”; 

“that one will, by following instructions, by the complete destruction of three fetters and the reduction of greed, hatred and delusion, become a Once-Returner, and having returned once more to this world, will put an end to suffering”; 

“that one will, by following instructions, by the complete destruction of the five lower fetters, be spontaneously reborn,^f153 and there will reach Nibbāna without returning from that world”; 

“that one will, by following instructions, by the destruction of the corruptions, gain in this very life the deliverance of mind, the deliverance through wisdom which is uncorrupted, and which one has understood and realised by one’s own super-knowledge.” 
This is the unsurpassed teaching in regard to the modes of receptivity to instruction... 
^n155 ‘Also unsurpassed is the Blessed Lord’s way of teaching Dhamma in regard to the knowledge of the liberation of others. 
The Blessed Lord knows, by his own skilled observation: 
“That one will, by the complete destruction of three fetters, become a Stream-Winner...; 

then with the reduction of greed, hatred and delusion, become a Once-Returner...; 

by the complete destruction of the five lower fetters, be spontaneously reborn...; 

by the destruction of the corruptions, gain in this very life the deliverance of mind, the deliverance through wisdom which is uncorrupted ... ʺ 

^n156 ‘Also unsurpassed is the Blessed Lord’s way of teaching Dhamma in regard to the doctrine of Eternalism.^f154
 There are three such theories: 
(1) Here, some ascetic or Brahmin, by means of ardour, endeavour, ... 
recalls various past existences ...
up to several hundred thousand births...^i[(as Sutta 1, verse 1.31).]
 In this way he remembers the details of his various past lives, and he says: 
“I know the past, whether the universe was expanding or contracting,^f155 but I do not know the future, whether it will expand or contract. 
The self and the world are eternal, barren, steady as a mountain-peak, rooted like a pillar. 

Beings run on, transmigrate, pass away and rearise, yet these persist eternally.” 
(2) Again, some ascetic or Brahmin recalls various existences ... 
^i[(as (1), but] “up to twenty aeons ... ʺ). 





(3) Again, some ascetic or Brahmin recalls various existence... 
^i[(as (i), but] “up to ten, twenty, thirty, forty aeons...”). 






This is the unsurpassed teaching in regard to the doctrine of Eternalism...
^n157 ‘Also unsurpassed is the Blessed Lord’s way of teaching Dhamma in regard to past lives. 
Here, some ascetic or Brahmin... recalls various past existences — 
one birth, two births, three, four, five, ten, twenty, thirty, forty, fifty, a hundred, a thousand, a hundred thousand lives, many aeons of contraction, of expansion, of contraction and expansion: 
“Then I was called so-and-so, this was my clan, my caste, I ate this, had these happy and unhappy experiences, lived for so long. And when I passed away from there I was reborn in such-and-such other circumstances. Passing away from there, I was reborn here.” In this way he remembers the details of his various past lives. There are devas whose life-span is not to be reckoned by counting or computation,^f156 yet whatever existence ^f157 they have previously experienced, whether in the World of Form or in the Formless World, whether conscious, unconscious or neither-conscious-nor-unconscious, they remember the details of those past lives. 
This is the unsurpassed teaching in regard to remembrance of past lives...



^n158 ‘Also unsurpassed is the Blessed Lord’s way of teaching Dhamma in regard to knowledge of the death and rebirth of beings. 
Here, some ascetic or Brahmin ... attains to such concentration of mind that he sees with the divine eye, purified and surpassing that of humans, beings passing away and arising: 
base and noble, well-favoured and ill-favoured, to happy and unhappy destinations as kamma directs them, and he knows: “These beings, on account of misconduct of body, speech or thought or disparaging the Noble Ones, have wrong view and will suffer the kammic fate of wrong view. At the breaking-up of the body after death they are reborn in a lower world, a bad destination, a state of suffering, hell. But these beings, on account of good conduct of body, speech or thought, of praising the Noble Ones, have right view and will reap the kammic reward of right view. At the breaking-up of the body after death they are reborn in a good destination, a heavenly world.” Thus with the divine eye, purified and surpassing that of humans, he sees beings passing away and rearising... 
This is the unsurpassed teaching in regard to knowledge of the death and birth of beings...
^n159 ‘Also unsurpassed is the Blessed Lord’s way of teaching Dhamma in regard to the supernormal powers. 
These are of two kinds. 
There is the kind that is bound up with the corruptions and with attachment,^f158 which is called “un-Ariyan”, 
and there is the kind that is free of the corruptions and not bound up with attachment, which is called “Ariyan”. 
What is the “un-Ariyan” supernormal power? 
Here some ascetic or Brahmin enjoys various supernormal powers: 
being one, he becomes many — being many, he becomes one; he appears and disappears; he passes through fences, walls and mountains unhindered as if through air; he sinks into the ground and emerges from it as if it were water; he walks on the water without breaking the surface as if on land; he flies cross-legged through the sky like a bird with wings; he even touches and strokes with his hand the sun and moon, mighty and powerful as they are; and he travels in the body as far as the Brahma world. 
That is the ʺun-Ariyariʺsupernormal power. 
And what is the “Ariyan” supernormal power? 
Here a monk, if he wishes: “Let me abide with the disgusting^f159 not feeling disgust”, can so abide, and if he wishes: 
“Let me abide with the non-disgusting feeling disgust”, he can so abide, ^i[also feeling either disgust or non-disgust in the presence of both] ... 


or: “Ignoring both the disgusting and the non-disgusting may I abide in equanimity, mindful and clearly aware”, he can so abide. 
That is the ʺAriyanʺ supernormal power, that is free of the corruptions and not bound up with attachment. 
This is the unsurpassed teaching in regard to the supernormal powers. 
This the Blessed Lord fully comprehends, and beyond it lies nothing further to be comprehended; and in such understanding there is no other ascetic or Brahmin who is greater or more enlightened than the Blessed Lord, as regards the supernormal powers.
^n160 ‘Whatever, Lord, it is possible for a clansman endowed with confidence to achieve by putting forth effort and by persistence, by human effort, human exertion and human endurance, ^f160 that the Blessed Lord has achieved. 
For the Blessed Lord gives himself up neither to the pleasures of the senses, which are base, vulgar, for worldlings and not for the Noble, and unprofitable, nor to self-torment, which is painful, ignoble and unprofitable.^f161 
The Blessed Lord is able, here and now,^f162 to enjoy the surpassing^f163 happiness of dwelling in the four jhānas. 
^n161 ‘Lord, if I were asked: 
“Well now, friend Sāriputta, have there ever been in the past any ascetics and Brahmins more exalted in enlightenment than the Blessed Lord?” I should say: “No.” 
If asked: “Will there be any such in the future?” I should say: “No.” 
If asked: “Is there any such at present ?ʺ I should say: “No.” 
Again, if I were asked: 
“Have there been any such in the past equal in enlightenment to the Blessed Lord?” I should say: “Yes.” 
If asked: “Will there be any such in the future?” “Yes.” 
But if I were asked: “Are there any such at present equal in enlightenment to the Blessed Lord?” I should say: “No.” 
And if I were then asked: 
“Venerable Sariputta, why do you accord this highest recognition to one and not the other?” 
I should say: “I have heard and received it from the Blessed Lord’s own lips: 
‘There have been in the past, and there will be in the future, Arahant Buddhas equal in enlightenment to myself.’ 
I have also heard and received it from the Blessed Lord’s own lips that 
it is not possible, it cannot be that in one and the same world-system two Arahant supreme Buddhas should arise simultaneously. ^f164
 No such situation can exist.”
‘Lord, if I were to reply thus to such questions, would I be speaking in conformity with the Blessed Lord’s word, and not misrepresenting him by departing from the truth? 
Would I be explaining Dhamma correctly, so that no fellow-follower of the Dhamma could contest it or find occasion for censure?’
‘Certainly, Sāriputta, if you answered like this you would not misrepresent me, you would be explaining Dhamma correctly and not laying yourself open to censure.’
^n162 At this, the Venerable Udayi said to the Lord: 
‘It is wonderful, Lord, it is marvellous how content the Blessed Lord is, how satisfied and restrained,^f165 
when being endowed with such power and influence he does not make a display of himself! 
If the wanderers professing other doctrines were able to discern in themselves even one of such qualities, they would proclaim it with a banner! 
It is wonderful ... 
that the Blessed Lord does not make display of himself!’
‘Well then, Udayi, just observe: 
so it is. 
If such wanderers were able to discern in themselves even one of such qualities, they would proclaim it with a banner. 
But the Tathagata is content,...
he does not make a display of himself.’ 
^n163 Then the Lord said to Sariputta: 
‘And therefore you, Sāriputta, should frequently speak about this matter to monks and nuns, to male and female lay-followers. 
And any foolish people who have doubts or queries about the Tathagata will, by listening to such talk, have their doubts and queries resolved.’
 This was how the Venerable Sariputta proclaimed his confidence in the Lord. 
And so one name for this exposition is ‘The Serene Faith’.

^ck#d29(^z1[Pasadika Sutta: The Delightful Discourse] )^n164 THUS HAVE I HEARD. 
Once the Lord was staying among the Sakyans, at the 〔School〕 building^f166 in the mango-grove belonging to the Vedhañña family.^f167 
At that time the Nigantha Nātaputta had just died at Pāvā.^f168 
And at his death the Niganthas were split into two parties, quarrelling and disputing, fighting and attacking each other with wordy warfare: 
‘You don’t understand this doctrine and discipline — I do!’ ‘How could you understand this doctrine and discipline?’ ‘Your way is all wrong — mine is right!’ ‘I am consistent — you aren’t!’ ‘You said last what you should have said first, and you said first what you should have said last!’ ‘What you took so long to think up has been refuted!’ ‘Your argument has been overthrown, you’re defeated!’ ‘Go on, save your doctrine — get out of that if you can!’ 
You would have thought the Niganthas, Nataputtaʹs disciples, were bent on killing each other. 
Even the white-robed lay followers were disgusted, displeased and repelled when they saw that their doctrine and discipline was so ill-proclaimed, so unedifyingly displayed, and so ineffectual in calming the passions, having been proclaimed by one not fully enlightened, and now with its support gone, without an arbiter.^f169
^n165 Now the novice Cunda, who had spent the Rains at Pāvā, came to Sāmāgama to see the Venerable Ananda. Saluting him, he sat down to one side and said: 
‘Sir, the Nigantha Nātaputta has just died at Pāvā.ʹ 
And he related what had happened. 
The Venerable Ananda said: 
‘Cunda, that is something that ought to be reported to the Blessed Lord. 
Let us go and tell him.’ 
‘Very good, sir’, said Cunda.
So they went to the Lord and told him. He said: 
‘Cunda, here is a doctrine and discipline that is ill-proclaimed, unedifyingly displayed and ineffectual in calming the passions because its proclaimer was not fully enlightened.

^n166 ‘Such being the case, Cunda, a disciple cannot live according to that doctrine and maintain proper conduct, nor live by it, but deviates from it. 
To him one might say: 
“Friend, this is what you have received,^f170 and you have your opportunity. ^f171


 Your teacher is not fully enlightened...
You cannot live according to that doctrine..., but deviate from it.” 
In this case, Cunda, the teacher is to blame, the doctrine is to blame, but the pupil is praiseworthy. 
And if anyone were to say to that pupil: 
“Come now, reverend sir, and practise according to the doctrine proclaimed and given out by your teacher” 
— then the one who urged this, the thing urged and the one who so practised would all gain much demerit.^f172 
Why? 
Because the doctrine is ill-proclaimed ...
^n167 ‘But here, Cunda, is a teacher who is not fully enlightened ... 
and a disciple lives according to that doctrine, and conforms to it. 
One might say to him: 
“Friend, what you have received is no good,^f173 your opportunity is a poor one;^f174 your teacher is not fully enlightened, his teaching is ill-proclaimed, ... 
but yet you continue to live according to it...
ʺIn this case the teacher, the doctrine and the disciple are all to blame. 
And if anyone were to say: 
“Well, reverend sir, by following that system you will be successful”, 
the one who so recommended it, that which was recommended, and the one who, on hearing such recommendation, should make still greater efforts, would all gain much demerit. 
Why? 
Because the doctrine is ill-proclaimed ...
^n168 ‘But here now is a teacher who is fully enlightened: his doctrine is well-proclaimed, edifyingly displayed, effectual in calming the passions because of that enlightened teacher, but the disciple does not live up to the doctrine..., 
but deviates from it. 
In that case one might say to him: 
“Friend, you have failed, you have missed your opportunity;^f175 your teacher is fully enlightened, his doctrine is well-proclaimed, ... 
but you do not follow it, you deviate from it.” 
In this case the teacher and the doctrine are praiseworthy, but the pupil is to blame. 
And if anyone were to say: 
“Well, reverend sir, you should follow the teaching proclaimed by your teacher”, 
then the one who urged this, that which was urged and the one who so practised would all gain much merit. 
Why? 
Because the doctrine is well-proclaimed... 
^n169 ‘But now, Cunda, here is a teacher who is fully enlightened, his doctrine is well-proclaimed, ... 
and the disciple, having taken it up, follows it, practising it properly and keeping to it. 
Someone might say to him: 
“Friend, what you have received is good, here is your opportunity,^f176 ... 

and you are following the doctrine of your teacher.” 
In this case the teacher and the doctrine are praiseworthy, and the pupil is also praiseworthy. 
And if anyone were to say to such a disciple: 
“Well reverend sir, by following that system you will be successful”, 
then the one who thus commended it, and that which was commended, and the one who, on hearing such commendation, should-make still greater efforts, would all gain much merit. 
Why? 
Because that is so when the doctrine and discipline are well-proclaimed, edifyingly displayed and effectual in calming the passions because of the fully-enlightened Teacher and supreme Buddha.
^n170 ‘But now, Cunda, suppose a Teacher has arisen in the world, an Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, and his doctrine is well-proclaimed, ... effectual in calming the passions because of that Teacher. 
But his disciples have not fully mastered that true Dhamma, the full purity of the holy life has not become clear and evident to them in the logic of its unfolding, ^f177 and has not been sufficiently grounded among them ^f178 being still in course of being well-proclaimed among humans 
at the time of the Teacher’s passing from among them.^f179 
That way, Cunda, the Teacher’s death would be a sad thing for his disciples. 
Why? 
They would think: “Our Teacher arose in the world for us, an Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, whose doctrine was well-proclaimed, ... but we did not fully master the true Dhamma... as long as it was well-proclaimed among humans, 
and now our Teacher has passed away from among us!” 
That way, the Teacher’s death would be a sad thing for his disciples.
^n171 ‘But suppose a Teacher has arisen in the world,... 
and his disciples have fully mastered the true Dhamma, the full purity of the holy life has become clear and evident to them in the logic of its unfolding, and has been sufficiently grounded among them while being thus well-proclaimed among humans by the time of 
the Teacher’s passing from them. 
That way, the Teacherʹs death would not be a sad thing for his disciples. 
Why? 
They would think: 
“Our Teacher arose in the world for us ... 
and we have fully mastered the true Dhamma ... 
while it was thus proclaimed among humans, and now our Teacher has passed away from among us.” 
That way, the Teacher’s s death would not be a sad thing for his disciples.
^n172 ‘But, Cunda, if the holy life^f180 is so circumstanced, and there is no teacher who is senior, of long standing, long-ordained, mature and advanced in seniority, 
then in such a case the holy life will be imperfect. 
But if such a teacher exists, 
then the holy life can be perfected in such a case.
^n173 ‘If in such a case there is such a senior teacher, but if there are no senior disciples among the monks, who are experienced, trained, skilled, who have attained peace from bondage,^f181 
who are able to proclaim the true Dhamma, able to refute any opposing doctrines that may arise by means of the true Dhamma, and, having done so, give a grounded exposition of Dhamma, 
then the holy life is not perfected.^f182



^n174 ‘In such cases, if there are such senior teachers, and such senior disciples, 

but there are no monks of middle standing with these qualities, ... 
or 〔despite the presence of these〕 no junior monks with these qualities,... 
no senior disciples among the nun,...
 no middle-ranking 
or junior nuns,...
no white-robed lay followers, 
male or 
female, 
celibate or otherwise, ^f183 
or if the teaching does not prosper and flourish, is not widespread, widely known, proclaimed far and wide,...













or 〔even if these conditions are fulfilled〕 has not gained the first place in public support, then the holy life is not perfected.
‘If, however, all these conditions are fulfilled, then the holy life is perfected.
^n175 ‘But, Cunda, I have now arisen in the world as an Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, the Dhamma is well-proclaimed, ... 
my disciples are proficient in the true Dhamma, ... 
the full purity of the holy life has become clear and evident to them in the logic of its unfolding ... 
But now I am an aged teacher of long standing, who went forth a long time ago, and my life is coming to its close.
ʹHowever, there are senior teachers among the monks, 
who are experienced, trained, skilled, who have attained peace from bondage, able to proclaim the true Dhamma, able to refute by means of the Dhamma any opposing doctrines that may arise and, having done so, give a grounded exposition of Dhamma. 
And there are middle-ranking monks who are disciplined and experienced, 
there are novices who are disciples, 
there are senior, 
middle-ranking 
and novice nuns who are disciples, 
there are white-robed lay followers, 
male and 
female, celibate 
and non-celibate, 
and the holy life I proclaim prospers and flourishes, is widespread, widely-known, proclaimed far and wide, well-proclaimed among humans.
^n176 ‘Among all the teachers now existing in the world, Cunda, I see none who has attained to such a position of fame and following as I have. 
Of all the orders and groups in the world, I see none as famous and well-followed as my Sangha of monks. 

If anyone were to refer to any holy way of life as being fully successful and perfect, 
with nothing lacking and nothing superfluous, well-proclaimed in the perfection of its purity, it is this holy life they would be describing. 


It was Uddaka Ramaputta^f184 who used to say: 
“He sees, but does not see.” 
What is it that, seeing, one does not see? 
You can see the blade of a well-sharpened razor, but not its edge. 
That is what he meant by saying: 
“He sees, but does not see.” 
He spoke in reference to a low, vulgar, worldly ignoble thing of no spiritual significance,^f185 a mere razor.
‘But if one were to use that expression properly: 
“He sees, but does not see”
, it would be like this. 

What he sees is a holy way of life which is fully successful and perfect, with nothing lacking and nothing superfluous, well-proclaimed in the perfection of its purity. 
If he were to deduct anything from it, thinking: “In this way it will be purerʺ, he does not see it. 
And if he were to add anything to it, thinking: “In this way it will be more complete”, then he does not see it.^f186
 That is the meaning of the saying: 
“He sees, but does not see.” 
Therefore, Cunda, if anyone were to refer to any holy way of life as being fully successful and perfect, ... 



it is this holy life that they would be describing.
^n177 ‘Therefore, Cunda, all you to whom I have taught these truths that I have realised by super-knowledge, should come together and recite them, setting meaning beside meaning and expression beside expression, without dissension, in order that this holy life may continue and be established for a long time for the profit and happiness of the many out of compassion for the world and for the benefit, profit and happiness of devas and humans.^f187 
And what are the things that you should recite together? 
They are: the four foundations of mindfulness, the four right efforts, the four roads to power, the five spiritual faculties, the five mental powers, the seven factors of enlightenment, the Noble Eightfold Path. 
These are the things you should recite together.

^n178 ‘And thus you must train yourselves, being assembled in harmony and without dissension. If a fellow in the holy life quotes Dhamma in the assembly, 
and if you think 
he has either misunderstood the sense or expressed it wrongly, 
you should neither applaud nor reject it, but should say to him: 
“Friend, if you mean such-and-such, you should put it either like this or like that: which is the more appropriate?” or: “If you say such-and-such, you mean either this or that: which is the more appropriate?” 
If he replies: 
“This meaning is better expressed like this than like that”, or: “The sense of this expression is this rather than that”, 
then his words should be neither rejected nor disparaged, but you should explain to him carefully the correct meaning and expression.
^n179 ‘Again, Cunda, if a fellow in the holy life quotes Dhamma in the assembly, 
and if you think 
he has misunderstood the sense though he has expressed it correctly, 
you should neither applaud nor reject it, but should say to him: 
“Friend, these words can mean either this or that: which sense is the more appropriate?” 
And if he replies: 
“They mean this”, 
then his words should be neither rejected nor disparaged, but you should explain to him carefully the correct meaning.
^n180 ‘And similarly, if you think he has got the right meaning but expressed it wrongly,... 






you should explain to him carefully the correct meaning and expression.
^n181 ‘But, Cunda, if you think he has got the right meaning and expressed it correctly,... 

you should say: 
ʺGood!ʺ^f188 and should applaud and congratulate him, 
saying: 
“We are lucky, we are most fortunate to find in you, friend, 
a companion in the holy life who is so well-versed in both the meaning and the expression!”
^n182 ‘Cunda, I do not teach you a Dhamma for restraining the corruptions that arise in the present life alone^f189 
I do not teach a Dhamma merely for their destruction in future lives, 
but one for their restraining in this life 
as well as for their destruction in future lives. 
Accordingly, Cunda, let the robe I have allowed you 
be simply for warding off the cold, for warding off the heat, for warding off the touch of gadfly, mosquito, wind, sun and creeping things, just so as to protect your modesty.^f190
 Let the alms-food I have allowed you be just enough 
for the support and sustenance of the body, for keeping it unimpaired for the furtherance of the holy life, with the thought: “Thus I shall eliminate the former feeling^f191 without giving rise to a new one — in that way I shall live without fault and in comfort.” 
Let the lodging I have allowed you be 
simply for warding off the cold, for warding off the heat, for warding off the touch of gadfly, mosquito, wind, sun and creeping things, just for allaying the perils of the seasons and for the enjoyment of seclusion. 
Let the provision of medicines and necessities for the treatment of sickness that I have allowed you be 
just for warding off feelings of sickness that have arisen, and for the maintenance of health.^f192
^n183 ‘It may be, Cunda, that wanderers of other sects might say: 
“The ascetics who follow the Sakyan are addicted to a life of devotion to pleasure.ʺ^f193 
If so, they should be asked: 
“What kind of a life of devotion to pleasure, friend? 
For such a life can take many different forms.” 
There are, Cunda, four kinds of life devoted to pleasure which are low, vulgar, worldly, ignoble and not conducive to welfare,^f194 not leading to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to tranquillity, to realisation, to enlightenment, to Nibbana. 
What are they? 
Firstly, a foolish person^f195 takes pleasure and delight in killing living beings. 
Secondly, someone takes pleasure and delight in taking that which is not given. 
Thirdly, someone takes pleasure and delight in telling lies. 
Fourthly, someone gives himself up to the indulgence in and enjoyment of the pleasures of the five senses. 




These are the four kinds of life devoted to pleasure which are low, vulgar,... not leading to disenchantment, ... to enlightenment, to Nibbāna.
‘And it may be that those of other sects might say: 
“Are the followers of the Sakyan given to these four forms of pleasure-seeking?” 
They should be told: “No!” 
for they would not be speaking correctly about you, they would be slandering you with false and untrue statements.
^n184  ʹThere are, Cunda, these four kinds of life devoted to pleasure which are entirely conducive^f196 to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to tranquillity, to realisation, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna. 
What are they? 
Firstly, a monk, detached from all sense-desires ^f197 detached from unwholesome mental states, enters and remains in the first jhāna, which is with thinking and pondering, born of detachment, filled with delight and happiness. 

And with the subsiding of thinking and pondering, by gaining inner tranquillity and oneness of mind, he enters and remains in the second jhāna, which is without thinking and pondering, born of concentration, filled with delight and happiness. 

Again, with the fading of delight, remaining imperturbable, mindful and clearly aware, he experiences in himself that joy of which the Noble Ones say: “Happy is he who dwells with equanimity and mindfulness”, 
he enters and remains in the third jhāna. 
Again, having given up pleasure and pain, and with the disappearance of former gladness and sadness, he enters and remains in the fourth jhāna, which is beyond pleasure and pain, and purified by equanimity and mindfulness.

‘These are the four kinds of life devoted to pleasure which are entirely conducive to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to tranquillity, to realisation, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna. 
So if wanderers from other sects should say that 
the followers of the Sakyan are addicted to these four forms of pleasure-seeking, 
they should be told: 
“Yes”, for they would be speaking correctly about you, they would not be slandering you with false or untrue statements.
^n185 ‘Then such wanderers might ask: 
“Well then, those who are given to these four forms of pleasure-seeking - how many fruits, how many benefits can they expect?” 
And you should reply: 
“They can expect four fruits, four benefits. 
What are they? 
The first is when a monk by the destruction of three fetters has become a Stream-Winner, no more subject to rebirth in lower worlds, firmly established, destined for full enlightenment; 

the second is when a monk by the complete destruction of three fetters and the reduction of greed, hatred and delusion, has become a Once-Returner, and having returned once more to this world, will put an end to suffering; 

the third is when a monk, by the complete destruction of the five lower fetters, has been spontaneously reborn, and there will reach Nibbāna without returning from that world. 

The fourth is when a monk, by the destruction of the corruptions in this very life has, by his own knowledge and realisation, attained to Arahantship, to the deliverance of heart and through wisdom. 

Such are the four fruits and the four benefits that one given to these four forms of pleasure-seeking can expect.”
^n186 ‘Then such wanderers might say: 
“The doctrines of the Sakyan’s followers are not well-founded.” 
They should be told: 
“Friend, the Lord who knows and sees has taught and proclaimed to his disciples principles which are not to be transgressed as long as life shall last. 
Just like a locking-post^f198 or an iron post which is deep-based, well-planted and unshakeable, immovable are these doctrines he has taught. 
And any monk who is an Arahant, whose corruptions are destroyed, who has lived the life, done what was to be done, laid down the burden, gained the true goal, who has completely destroyed the fetter of becoming, 
and is liberated by supreme insight, is incapable of doing nine things: 
(1) He is incapable of deliberately taking the life of a living being; (2) he is incapable of taking what is not given so as to constitute theft; (3) he is incapable of sexual intercourse; (4) he is incapable of telling a deliberate lie; (5) he is incapable of storing up goods for sensual indulgence as he did formerly in the household life; (6) he is incapable of acting wrongly through attachment; (7) he is incapable of acting wrongly through hatred; (8) he is incapable of acting wrongly through folly; (9) he is incapable of acting wrongly through fear. 
These are the nine things which an Arahant, whose corruptions are destroyed, cannot do...ʺ 
^n187 ‘Or such wanderers might say: 
“As regards past times, the ascetic Gotama displays boundless knowledge and insight, but not about the future, as to what it will be and how it will be.” 
That would be to suppose that knowledge and insight about one thing are to be produced by knowledge and insight about something else, as fools imagine. 
As regards the past, the Tathāgata has knowledge of past lives. 
He can remember as far back as he wishes. 
As for the future, this knowledge, born of enlightenment, arises in him: 
“This is the last birth, there will be no more becoming.”
‘If “the past” refers to what is not factual, to fables,^f199 to what is not of advantage, the Tathāgata makes no reply. 
If it refers to what is factual, not fabulous, but which is not of advantage, the Tathāgata makes no reply. 
But if “the past” refers to what is factual, not fabulous, and which is of advantage, then the Tathāgata knows the right time to reply. 
The same applies to the future 
and the present. 
Therefore, Cunda, the Tathāgata is called the one who declares the time, the fact, the advantage, the Dhamma and the discipline. 
That is why he is called ^i[Tathāgata.]^f200
^n188  
‘Cunda, whatever in this world with its devas and maras and Brahmās, with its ascetics and Brahmins, its princes and people, is seen by people, heard, sensed,^f201 cognised, whatever was ever achieved, sought after or mentally pondered upon — all that has been fully understood by the Tathāgata. 
That is why he is called ^i[Tathāgata.]
 Between the night in which the Tathāgata gains supreme enlightenment, Cunda, and the night in which he attains the Nibbāna-element without remainder,^f202 whatever he proclaims, says or explains is so and not otherwise. 
That is why he is called ^i[Tathāgata.]
 And of this world with its devas and māras and Brahmās, with its ascetics and Brahmins, its princes and people, the Tathāgata is the unvanquished conqueror, the seer and ruler of all. 
That is why he is called ^i[Tathāgata.]

^n189 ‘Or such wanderers might say: 
“Does the Tathāgata exist after death?ʺ^f203 “Is that true, and any other view foolish?” 
They should be told: 
”Friend, this has not been revealed by the Lord.ʺ ... 


“Does the Tathagata not exist after death?ʺ ... 




”Does he both exist and not exist after death?ʺ ... 




“Does he neither exist nor not exist after death?” 
They should be told: 
“Friend, this has not been revealed by the Lord.”


‘Then they may say: “Why has the ascetic Gotama not revealed this?” 
They should be told: 
“Friend, this is not conducive to welfare or to the Dhamma, or to the higher holy life, or to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation, tranquillity, realisation, enlightenment, Nibbāna. That is why the Lord has not revealed it.”
^n190 ‘Or they may say: “Well, friend, what ^i[has] the ascetic Gotama revealed?” 

They should be told: 
“‘This is suffering’ has been declared by the Lord; ‘This is the arising of suffering’... ʹThis is the cessation of sufferingʹ...ʹThis is the path leading to the cessation of suffering’ has been declared by the Lord.” 
‘Then they may say: 
“Why has this been declared by the ascetic Gotama?” 
They should be told: 
“Friend, this is conducive to welfare, to Dhamma, to the higher holy life, to perfect disenchantment,^f204 to dispassion, to cessation, to tranquillity, to realisation, to enlightenment, to Nibbāna. That is why the Lord has revealed it.”
^n191 ‘Cunda, those bases of speculation about the beginnings of things which I have explained to you as they should be explained, should I now explain to you as they should not be explained?^f205
 
And likewise about the future? 

What are the speculations about the past... ? 

There are ascetics and Brahmins who say and believe: 
“The self and the world are eternal. This is true and any other view is erroneous.” 

“The self and the world are not eternal.” ... 
“ʹThe self and the world are both eternal and not eternal.” ... 
“The self and the world are neither eternal nor not eternal.” ... 
“The self and the world are self-created.” ... 
“They are created by another.” ... 
“They are both self-created and created by another.”...
“They are neither self-created nor created by another, but have arisen by chance.” 
And similarly with regard to pleasure and pain.







^n192 ‘Now, Cunda, I go to those ascetics and Brahmins who hold any of these views and if, being asked, they confirm that they do hold such views, I do not admit their claims. 







Why not? 
Because, Cunda, different beings hold different opinions on such matters. 
Nor do I consider such theories equal to my own, still less superior. 
I am their superior in regard to the higher exposition. 
^n193 36.39. As for those bases of speculation about the beginning of things which I have explained to you as they should be explained, why should I now explain them to you as they should not be explained?



























^n194 ‘And what about those speculators about the future? 

There are some ascetics and Brahmins who say: 
“The self after death is material and healthy”; 

“...immaterial”; 
“...both”; 
ʺ... neitherʺ; 
“The self is conscious after death”; 
ʺ ... unconsciousʺ; 
ʺ... bothʺ; ʺ...neitherʺ; 
“The self perishes, is destroyed, ceases to be after death. This is true and any other view is erroneous.”












^n195 ‘Now, Cunda, I go to those ascetics and Brahmins who hold any of these views and if, being asked, 












they confirm that they do hold such views, I do not admit their claims. 
Why not? 
Because, Cunda, different beings hold different opinions on such matters. 
Nor do I consider such theories equal to my own, still less superior. 
I am their superior in regard to the higher exposition. 
As for those bases of speculation about the future which I have explained to you as they should be explained, 
why should I now explain them to you as they should not be explained?
^n196 ‘And, Cunda, for the destruction of all such views about the past and the future, for transcending them, I have taught and laid down the four foundations of mindfulness. 
What are the four? 
Here, Cunda, a monk dwells contemplating body as body, ardent, clearly aware and mindful, having put aside hankering and fretting for the world. 
He dwells contemplating feelings as feelings,... 
mind as mind...; 
he dwells contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects, ardent, clearly aware and mindful, having put aside hankering and fretting for the world. 
That is how, Cunda, for the destruction of such views about the past and the future, and for transcending them, I have taught and laid down the four foundations of mindfulness.’
^n197 During this time the Venerable Upavāna^f206 was standing behind the Lord, fanning him. 
And he said: 
‘It is wonderful, Lord, it is marvellous! 
Lord, this exposition of Dhamma is delightful — highly delightful! 
Lord, what is the name of this discourse?’ 
‘Well, Upavāna, you can remember it as “The Delightful Discourse.ʺʹ 
 Thus the Lord spoke, 
and the Venerable Upavāna rejoiced and was delighted with his words.

^ck#d30(^z1[Lakkhaṇa Sutta: The Marks of a Great Man] )^n198 THUS HAVE I HEARD.^f207 
Once the Lord was staying at Savatthi, in Jetavana, Anathapindikaʹs park. 
‘Monks!’ 
he said, and the monks replied:
 ‘Lord.’ 
The Lord said: 
^n199‘There are, monks, these thirty-two marks peculiar to a Great Man,^f208 and for that Great Man who possesses them, only two careers are open. 
 If he lives the household life, he will become a ruler, a wheel-turning righteous monarch of the law, conqueror of the four quarters, who has established the security of his realm and is possessed of the seven treasures. 
These are: 
the Wheel Treasure, the Elephant Treasure, the Horse Treasure, the Jewel Treasure, the Woman Treasure, the Householder Treasure, and, as seventh, the Counsellor Treasure. 
He has more than a thousand sons who are heroes, of heroic stature, conquerors of the hostile army. 
He dwells having conquered this sea-girt land without stick or sword, by the law. 
But if he goes forth from the household life into homelessness, he will become an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, who has drawn back the veil from the world.
^n200 ‘And what are these thirty-two marks? 


(1) He has feet with level tread.^f209 This is one of the marks of a Great Man. 
(2) On the soles of his feet are wheels with a thousand spokes, complete with felloe and hub. 
(3) He has projecting heels. 
(4) He has long fingers and toes.^f210
 (5) He has soft and tender hands and feet. 
(6) His hands and feet are net-like.^f211
 (7) He has high-raised ankles.^f212
 (8) His legs are like an antelope’s. 
(9) Standing and without bending, he can touch and rub his knees with either hand. 
(10) His male organs are enclosed in a sheath. 
(11) His complexion is bright, the colour of gold. 
(12) His skin is delicate and so smooth that no dust can adhere to his body. 
(13) His body-hairs are separate, one to each pore. 
(14) His body-hairs grow upwards, each one bluish-black like collyrium,^f213 curling in rings to the right. 
(15) His body is divinely straight.^f214
 (16) He has the seven convex surfaces.^f215
 (17) The front part of his body is like a lion’s. 
(18) There is no hollow between his shoulders. 
(19) He is proportioned like a banyan-tree: the height of his body is the same as the span of his outstretched arms, and conversely. 
(20) His bust is evenly rounded. 
(21) He has a perfect sense of taste.^f216 
(22) He has jaws like a lion’s. 
(23) He has forty teeth. 
(24) His teeth are even. 
(25) There are no spaces between his teeth. 
(26) His canine teeth are very bright. 
(27) His tongue is very long. 
(28) He has a Brahmā-like voice, like that of the ^i[karavīka]-bird. 
(29) His eyes are deep blue. 
(30) He has eyelashes like a cow’s. 
(31) The hair^f217 between his eyes is white and soft like cotton-down. 
(32) His head is like a royal turban.^f218 This is one of the marks of a Great Man.
‘These, monks, are the thirty-two marks peculiar to a Great Man, and for that Great Man who possesses them only two courses are open...


And sages of other communions^f219 know these thirty-two marks, 
but they do not know the karmic reasons for the gaining of them.
^n201 ‘Monks, in whatever former life, former existence or dwelling-place the Tathagata, being born a human being, undertook mighty deeds to good purpose, unwavering in good conduct of body, speech and thought, in generosity, self-discipline, observance of the fast-day, in honouring parents, ascetics and Brahmins and the head of the clan, and in other highly meritorious acts; 
by performing that kamma, heaping it up, lavishly and abundantly, at the breaking-up of the body after death he was reborn in a happy state, in a heavenly world, 
where he was endowed beyond other devas in ten respects: in length of heavenly life, beauty, happiness, splendour, influence, and in heavenly sights, sounds, smells, tastes and contacts. 
Falling away from there and coming to be reborn here on earth, he acquired this mark of the Great Man: 
(1) feet with level tread, 
so that he places his foot evenly on the ground, lifts it evenly, and touches the ground evenly with the entire sole.
^n202 ‘Being endowed with this mark, if he keeps to the household life, he will become a wheel-turning monarch...



Conquering without stick or sword, but by justice, he rules over this earth as far as its ocean-boundaries, a land open, uninfested by brigands, free from jungle, powerful, prosperous, happy and free from perils. 
As a ruler, how does he benefit? 
He cannot be impeded by any human foe with ill-intent. 
That is his benefit as a ruler. 
And if he goes forth into homelessness, he will become a fully-enlightened Buddha ... 
As such, how does he benefit? 
He cannot be impeded by any enemy or adversary from within or without, from greed, hatred or delusion, nor by any ascetic or Brahmin, any deva, mara or Brahma, or any being in the world. 
That is his benefit as a Buddha.’ 
This was what the Lord declared.
^n203 About this it was said:
‘Truthful, righteous, tamed and stilled, 
Pure and virtuous, keeping fasts, 
Generous, harming none, at peace 
He undertook this mighty task, 
And at his end to heaven went, 
To dwell in joy and happiness. 
Returned from there to earth, his feet 
With level tread did touch the ground. 
Assembled augurs then declared: 
“For him who level treads the ground, No obstacles can bar his path, 
If he leads the household life, Or if he leaves the world behind: 
This the mark does clearly show. 
If a layman, no adversary, 
No foe can stand before him. 
No human power exists that can 
Deprive him of his kamma’s fruit. 
Or if the homeless life’s his choice: 
On renunciation bent, and clear Of vision — 
chief of men he’ll be, Peerless, never more reborn: 
This the law shall be for him.”’
^n204 ‘Monks, in whatever former life ... the Tathagata, being born a human being, lived for the happiness of the many, as a dispeller of fright and terror, provider of lawful protection and shelter, and supplying all necessities, by performing that kamma, ... 
was reborn in a happy state, a heavenly world... 
Falling away from there and 
coming to be reborn here on earth, he acquired this mark of the Great Man: 
(2) on the soles of his feet are wheels of a thousand spokes, complete with felloe and hub.
‘Being endowed with this mark, if he keeps to the household life, he will become a wheel-turning monarch ... 
As a ruler, how does he benefit? 
He has a great retinue: 
he is surrounded by Brahmin householders, citizens and villagers, treasurers, guards, doorkeepers, ministers, tributary kings, tenants-in-chief, and pages. 
That is his benefit as a ruler. 
And if he goes forth into homelessness, he will become a fully-enlightened Buddha...
As such, how does he benefit? 
He has a large retinue: 
he is surrounded by monks, nuns, male and female lay-followers, devas and humans, asuras,^f220 nāgas and gandhabbas. ^f221
 That is his benefit as a Buddha.’ 
This was what the Lord declared.
^n205 About this it was said:
‘In times gone by, in former births 
As man, to many doing good, 
Dispelling fright and panic fear, 
Eager to guard and give defence, 
He undertook this mighty task, 
And at his end to heaven went, To dwell in joy and happiness. 
Returned from there to earth, his feet 
Are found to bear the mark of wheels, 
Each a thousand-spoked, complete. 
Assembled augurs then declared, 
Seeing these many marks of merit: 
“Great will be his following, All his foes he will subdue. 
This is the wheel-marks clearly show. 
If he does not renounce the world, 
He’ll turn the Wheel, and rule the earth. 
The nobles will his vassals be, 
All in attendance on his power. 
But if the homeless life’s his choice: 
On renunciation bent, and clear Of vision — men and devas asuras, sakkas, rakkhasas,^f222
gandhabbas, nagas, garudas, 
Four-foot beasts will serve him too, 
Unrivalled, by devas and by men 
Alike revered in all his glory.”’
^n206 ‘Monks, in whatever former life...
the Tathāgata, being born a human being, rejecting the taking of life and abstaining from it, and laying aside stick and sword, dwelt, kind and compassionate, having friendship and sympathy for all living beings, by performing that kamma, ... 
was reborn in a happy state ... 
Falling away from there and coming to be reborn on earth, he acquired these three marks of the Great Man: 
(3) projecting heels, (4) long fingers and toes, and (15) a divinely straight body.
‘Being endowed with these marks, if he keeps to the household life,...
as a ruler, how does he benefit? 
He is long-lived, long-enduring, attaining a great age, and during that time no human foe can possibly take his life...

As a Buddha, how does he benefit? 
He is long-lived ... ; no foe, whether an ascetic or Brahmin, a deva, mara or Brahma, or anyone in the world can possibly take his life. 
That is his benefit as a Buddha.’ 
This was what the Lord declared.
^n207 About this it was said:
‘Knowing well their dread of death, 
Beings he forbore to kill. 
This goodness earnt him heavenly birth, 
Where he rejoiced in merit’s fruit. 
Returning thence to earth he bore 
On his person these three marks: 
His heels are full and very long, 
Brahma like he’s straight of form, 
Fair to see, and shapely-limbed, 
His fingers tender, soft and long. 
By these three marks of excellence 
It’s known the youth will be long-lived. 
“Long he’ll live in household life 
Longer still as homeless one 
Practising the noble powers: 
So the three marks indicate.”’
^n208 ‘Monks, in whatever former life... 
the Tathagata became a giver of fine food, delicious and tasty, hard and soft, and of drinks, by performing that kamma, ... 
he was reborn in a heavenly world...
Falling away from there and being reborn here on earth, he acquired this mark of the Great Man: (16) the seven convex surfaces, 
on both hands, both feet, both shoulders and his trunk.
‘Being endowed with this mark,...
as a ruler, how does he benefit? 
He receives fine food and drinks... 



As a Buddha, likewise.’ 
This is what the Lord said.
^n209 About this it was said:
‘Dispenser of delicious foods 
And finest-tasting drinks he was. 
This goodness brought him happy birth, 
And long he dwelt in Nandana.^f223
To earth returned, the seven signs 
On gently-swelling limbs he bore. 
Assembled augurs then declared, 
Fine food and drink he would enjoy: 
Not merely in the household life — 
For though he should renounce the world 
And cut the bonds of worldly living, 
Delicious food he’d still receive!’

 generosity, pleasing speech, beneficial conduct and impartiality, ...

(5) soft and tender hands and feet, and (6) net-like hands and feet.

All his retinue are well-disposed to him: Brahmin householders, citizens and villagers, treasurers, guards, doorkeepers,

As a Buddha, how does he benefit? 
All his followers are well-disposed to him: monks, nuns, male and female lay-folowers, devas and humans, asuras, nagas, gandhabbas. 
That is his benefit as a Buddha.’ 
This is what the Lord said.
^n211 About this it was said:
ʹThrough giving and through helpful acts, 
Pleasing speech and evenness 
Of mind, of benefit to all, 
He at death to heaven went. 
When he thence returned to earth, 
His hands and feet were soft and tender, 
His toes and fingers netwise spread. 
Very fair he was to see: Thus the infant was endowed. 
ʺHeʹll be ruler of the people, 
Surrounded by a faithful flock. 
Fair of speech, to good deeds given, 
In conduct virtuous and wise. 
But if the joys of sense he spurns, 
A Conqueror, he will teach the path, 
And, delighted by his words, 
All those who hear will follow him In Dhamma’s great and lesser ways!ʺʹ

explaining this to people and being a bearer of welfare and happiness to beings, a dispenser of Dhamma,...
on returning to this earth he acquired these two marks of the Great Man: 
(7) high-raised ankles, and (14) upward-growing body-hairs.
‘Being endowed with these marks,...
as a ruler, how does he benefit? 
He becomes the chief, foremost, highest, supreme among the unrenounced^f225 ... 

As a Buddha, 
he becomes the chief, foremost, highest, supreme among all beings. 
That is his benefit as a Buddha.’ 
This was what the Lord declared. 
^n213 About this it was said: 
ʹOne time he spoke of all that’s good, 
Preaching loud to all mankind, 
Bringing blessings to all beings, 
Liberal dispenser of the law. 
For such conduct and such deeds, 
Heavenly birth was his reward. 
Here returned, two marks were his, 
Marks of happiness supreme: 
Upward-growing body-hairs, 
Ankles high above the foot, 
Built up beneath the flesh and skin, 
Well-formed above, and beautiful. 
“If he leads the household life, 
The greatest riches will be his, 
No greater man will be found: 
As Jambudipāʹs Lord he’ll rule. 
If, supremely strong, he leaves the world, 
He will be the chief of beings, 
No man greater will be found: 
As Lord of all the world he’ll rule.ʺʹ 
^n214 ‘Monks, in whatever former life...
the Tathagata became a skilled exponent of a craft, a science, a way of conduct or action, thinking: 
“What can I learn quickly and acquire, quickly practise, without undue weariness?ʺ... 
on returning to earth, 
he acquires this mark of the Great Man: 
(8) legs like an antelope’s.
‘Being endowed with this mark,...

as a ruler he quickly acquires whatever things befit a ruler, 
the things that pertain to a ruler, delight him and are appropriate to him. 
As a Buddha, likewise.’ 


This was what the Lord declared.
^n215 About that it was said:
‘Arts and sciences, ways and deeds: 
“Let me learn with ease”, he says. 
Skills that harm no living thing 
Fast he learnt, with little toil. 
From such deeds, skilled and sweet, 
Graceful and fair his limbs will be, 
While fairly set in spiral curves 
From tender skin the hairs stand up. 
Antelope-legged is such a man: 
Wealth, they say, will soon be his. 
“Each single hairlet brings him luck, 
If he maintains the household life. 
But should he choose to leave the world 
On renunciation set, 
Clear-eyed, all things he’ll quickly find 
Befitting such a lofty course.ʺʹ.
^n216 ‘Monks, in whatever former life...
the Tathāgata approached an ascetic or Brahmin and asked: 
“Sir, what is the good, what is the bad? What is blameworthy, what is not? What course is to be followed, what is not? What, if I do it, will be to my lasting sorrow and harm, what to my lasting happiness?ʺ^f226... 
on returning to this earth, 
he acquired this mark of the Great Man: 
(12) his skin is so delicate and smooth that no dust can adhere to his body.
‘Being endowed with this mark,... 
as a ruler he will be very wise, and among the unrenounced there will be none equal or superior to him in wisdom ... 


As a Buddha 
he will have great wisdom, extensive wisdom, joyous wisdom, swift wisdom, penetrative wisdom, discerning wisdom,^f227 and among all beings there will be none equal to him or superior to him in wisdom.’ 

This was what the Lord declared.
^n217 About this it was said:
ʹIn former days, in former births, 
Eager to know, a questioner, 
He waited on the homeless ones: 
Keen to learn the truth, he would 
Heed their words about life’s goal. 
The fruit of this, when born again 
As man, his skin was soft and tender. 
Assembled augurs thus declared: 
“Subtle meanings he’ll discern. 
If he does not leave the world, 
He’ll be a wheel-revolving king Wise to know all subtleties, 
Equalled or surpassed by none. 
But should he choose to leave the world 
On renunciation set, 
Highest wisdom will be his, 
Enlightenment supreme and vast.ʺʹ 
^n218 ‘Monks, in whatever former life...

the Tathāgata lived without anger, perfectly unruffled, and even after many words had been uttered was not abusive, or agitated, or wrathful, or aggressive, displaying neither anger nor hatred nor resentment, 
but was in the habit of giving away fine, soft rugs, cloaks, fine linen, cotton, silk and woollen stuffs,...
on returning to this earth, 
he acquired this mark of the Great Man: 
(11) a bright complexion, the colour of gold.
‘Being endowed with this mark,...
as a ruler he will receive such fine stuffs,...


as a Buddha, likewise.’ 


This was what the Lord declared.
^n219 About this it was said:
‘Established in goodwill, he gave 
Gifts of clothing, soft and fine. 
In former lives he thus dispensed 
As the rain-god pours down showers. 
This goodness brought him heavenly birth. 
Where he rejoiced in merit’s fruit. 
That time past, like fine-wrought gold 
His body is, more fair than all 
The gods he seems, great Indra’s like. 
‘If he lives the household life, 
He’ll regulate this wicked world, 
And, for what he’s done, 
receive Clothes of finest quality, Rugs and coverlets of the best. 
And should he choose to leave the world, 
Such things likewise he’ll receive: 
Virtue’s fruit can not be lost.ʺʹ 
^n220 ‘Monks, in whatever former life ... 
the Tathāgata reunited those long-lost with relatives, friends and companions who had missed them, 
reunited mother with child and child with mother, father with child and child with father, brother with brother, brother with sister and sister with brother, making them one again with great rejoicing,... 
on returning to earth 
he acquired this mark of the Great Man: 
(10) his male organs are enclosed in a sheath.
‘Being endowed with this mark,...

as a ruler he will have numerous sons, more than a thousand sons, powerfully built heroes, crushers of the enemy host. 

As a Buddha, likewise.’ 


This was what the Lord declared.
^n221 About this it was said:
ʹIn former days, in former births, 
Long-lost friends and relatives, 
Companions too, he brought together, 
Thus uniting them in joy. 
This good deed brought heavenly birth, 
Bliss and joy were his reward. 
When he thence returned to earth, 
Sheath-enclosed his organs were. 
“Numerous children such will have, 
More than a thousand sons are his, 
Hero-champions, conquerors, 
And filial too, the layman’s joy. 
But if he leaves the world, still more 
With children he will be endowed: 
Those who depend upon his word. 
And so, renounced or not, this sign Such benefits as this portends.”’
^i[End of first recitation-section〕] 
^n222 ‘Monks, in whatever former life... 
the Tathāgata, considering the welfare of people, knew the nature of each, knew each one himself, and knew how each one differed: 
“This one deserves such-and-such, that one deserves so-and-so”, 
so he distinguished them,... 
on returning to earth he acquired these two marks of the Great Man: 
(19) he is proportioned like a banyan-tree, and (9) standing, without bending, he can touch and rub his knees with both hands.
‘Being endowed with these marks,... 

as a ruler he will be rich, of great wealth and resources, having a full treasury of gold and silver, all sorts of goods, and his granary will be full of corn. 

As a Buddha 
he will be wealthy and rich, 
and these will be his treasures: 
faith, morality, moral shame,^f228 moral dread,^f229 learning, renunciation^f230 and wisdom.’ 

This was what the Lord declared:
^n223 About this it was said:
‘Weighing in the balance, noting, 
Seeking people’s benefit, Seeing: 
“This one that deserves, 
And that one this”, he judged them. 
Now he can unbending stand 
And touch his knees with both his hands, 
And his tree-like girth and height 
Is the fruit of virtuous deeds. 
Those who read the marks and signs, 
Experts in such lore declare: 
“Things that suit the household life 
As a child he’ll get in plenty, 
Much worldly wealth as this world’s lord, 
As befits a layman, shall be his. 
But should he worldly wealth renounce, 
He’ll gain the wealth that’s unsurpassed.”’
^n224 ‘Monks, in whatever former life the Tathāgata... 
desired the welfare of the many, their advantage, comfort, freedom from bondage, thinking 
how they might increase in faith, morality, learning, renunciation, in Dhamma, in wisdom, in wealth and possessions, in bipeds and quadrupeds, in wives and children, in servants, workers and helpers, in relatives, friends and acquaintances,... 
on returning to earth 
he acquired these three marks of the Great Man: 
(17) the front part of his body is like a lion’s, (18) there is no hollow between his shoulders, and (20) his bust is evenly rounded.
‘Being endowed with these marks,...
as a ruler he cannot lose anything: 
wealth and possessions, bipeds and quadrupeds, wives and children losing nothing, he will succeed in all things. 

As a Buddha he cannot lose anything: 
faith, morality, learning, renunciation or wisdom — losing nothing, he will succeed in all things.’ 

This was what the Lord declared.
^n225 About this it was said:

‘Faith, morality, learning, wisdom, 
Restraint and justice, much good else, 
Wealth, possessions, wives and sons, 
Flocks, kin, friends, colleagues, 
Strength, good looks and happiness: 
These things he wished for others 
That they might keep and never lose. 
“So, lion-fronted, he was born, 
Not hollow-backed, and round before. 
Through past good kamma well stored up, 
With such birth-marks spared all loss, 
In household life he’s rich in goods, 
In wife and sons and quadrupeds, 
Or if renounced, possessing naught, 
Supreme enlightenment is his, Where no failure enters in.”’ 
^n226 ‘Monks, in whatever former life the Tathāgata...
was one who avoided harming beings by hand, by stones, stick or sword,... 
on returning to earth 
he acquired this mark of the Great Man: (21) he has a perfect sense of taste. Whatever he touches with the tip of his tongue he tastes in his throat, and the taste is dispersed everywhere.
‘Being endowed with this mark,...
as a ruler 
he will suffer little distress or sickness, his digestion will be good, being neither too cold nor too hot.^f231

 As a Buddha likewise, 
he is also equable and tolerant of exertion.’ 

This was what the Lord declared.
^n227 About this it was said:
ʹHarming none by hand, stick, stone, 
Causing death to none by sword, 
Harmless, threatening none with bonds, 
With happy birth he gained the fruit 
Of these good deeds, and then reborn, 

Erect his taste-buds, 
and well-set.^f232
Those who know the marks declare: 
“Great happiness will be his lot 
As layman or as wanderer: 
That’s the meaning of this sign.”’
^n228 ‘Monks, in whatever former life the Tathāgata...
was accustomed to look at people not askance, obliquely or furtively, ^f233 but directly, openly and straight-forwardly, and with a kindly glance,... 
on returning to earth 
he acquired these two marks of the Great Man: 
(29) deep blue eyes, and (30) eyelashes like a cow’s.
‘Being endowed with these marks,...

he will be looked upon with love by the common people; he will be popular and loved by Brahmin householders citizens and villagers, treaturers, guards, doorkeepers,..

As a Buddha, 
he will be popular with and loved by monks, nuns, male and female lay-followers, devas and humans, asuras, nagas and gandhabbas.’ 

This was what the Lord declared.
^n229 About this it was said:
‘Not looking askance, obliquely, or 
Turning aside his glance, he looks 
Direct and openly at folk 
With candour and with kindly eye. 
In happy place reborn, he there 
Enjoys the fruits of his good deeds. 
Reborn here, his lashes are 
Like a cow’s; his eyes are blue. 
Those who know such things declare 
(Interpreting the marks with skill), 
“A child with such fine eyes will be 
One who’s looked upon with joy. 
If a layman, thus he’ll be 
Pleasing to the sight of all. 
If ascetic he becomes, 
Then loved as healer of folk’s woes.”’
^n230 ‘Monks, in whatever former life the Tathāgata...

on returning to earth 
he acquired this mark of the Great Man: 
(32) a head like a royal turban.
‘Being endowed with this mark,...
as a ruler 
he will receive the loyalty of Brahmin householders, citizens...

As a Buddha 
he will receive the loyalty of monks, nuns...’ 

This was what the Lord declared.
^n231 About this it was said:
ʹHe led the way in conduct then, 
Intent on living righteously. 
Thus folk were loyal to him here, 
And heavenly reward was his. 
And after that reward was done, 
He reappeared with turbaned head. 
Those who know the signs declared: 
“He will be the first of men, 
All will serve him in this life 
Just as was the case before. 
If a nobleman of wealth, 
He’ll gain the service of his folk, 
But should he leave the world, this man 
Of doctrine will a master be, 
And all the folk will flock to hear 
The teaching that he will proclaim.”’
^n232 ‘Monks, is whatever former life the Tathāgata,... 
rejecting false speech, put away lies and became a truth-speaker, wedded to the truth, reliable, consistent, not deceiving the world,... 
on returning to earth 
he acquired these two marks of the Great Man: 
(13) his body-hairs separate, one to each pore, and (31) the hair between his brows white and soft like cotton-down.
‘Being endowed with these marks,... 
as a ruler 
he will be obeyed by Brahmin householders...

As a Buddha he will be obeyed by monks...’ 


This was what the Lord declared.
^n233 About this it was said:
‘True to his promise in past births, 
Sincere of speech, he shunned all lies. 
Breaker of his word to none, 
He pleased by truth and honesty. 
White and bright and soft as down 
The hair appeared between his brows, 
And from one pore no two hairs grew, 
But each one separate appeared. 
Assembled augurs thus declared 
(Having read the marks with skill): 
“With such a mark between the brows, 
And such hairs, he’ll be obeyed 
By all, and if a layman still, 
They’ll respect him for past deeds; 
If renounced, possessionless, 
As Buddha they will worship him.”’
^n234 ‘Monks, in whatever former life the Tathāgata,... 
rejecting slander, abstained from it, not repeating there what he had heard here to the detriment of these, or repeating what he had heard there to the detriment of those... Thus he was a reconciler of those at variance and an encourager of those at one, rejoicing in peace, loving it, delighting in it, one who spoke up for peace (^i[as Sutta 1, verse 1.9)]. 
On returning to earth 
he acquired these two marks of the Great Man: 
(23) forty teeth, and (25) no spaces between the teeth.
‘Being endowed with these marks,... 
as a ruler, his followers: 
Brahmin householders, citizens...
will not be divided among themselves. 
Likewise as a Buddha, his followers: 
monks, nuns...
will not be divided among themselves.’ 
This was what the Lord declared.
^n235 About this it was said:
ʹHeʹs no speaker of wicked words 
That cause dissension or increase it, 
Prolonging strife and bitterness, 
Leading to good friendship’s end. 
What he spoke was all for peace, 
And relinking severed bonds. 
His power he used to end all strife, 
Harmony was his delight. 
In happy realm reborn, he there 
Enjoyed the fruits of his good deeds. 
Returned to earth, his teeth grew close, 
Forty of them, firmly set. 
“If a nobleman of wealth, 
Gentle will his subjects be; 
If a recluse, free from taint, 
Well set-up his flock will be.ʺʹ^f234 
^n236 ‘Monks, in whatever former life the Tathāgata,...

(27) his tongue was very long, and (28) he had a Brahmā-like voice, like the ^i[karavīka-]bird.
‘Being endowed with these marks,...
as a ruler he will have a persuasive^f235 voice: all...Brahmin householders, citizens... 
will take his words to heart. 
As a Buddha, too, he will have a persuasive voice:

This was what the Lord declared.
^n237 About this it was said:
ʹHeʹs no speaker of abuse, 
Harsh and painful, hurting folk, 
His voice is gentle, kind and sweet, 
Appealing to the hearts of folk 
And delightful to their ears. 
In happy realm reborn, he there 
Enjoyed the fruits of his good deeds. 
Having tasted this reward, With 
Brahmā-voice endowed, to earth 

He returned, and long his tongue. 
“And what he says will carry weight. 
If layman, he will prosper much. 
But if this man should leave the world, 
Folk will take his words to heart, 
And set great store by all he says.ʺʹ 
^n238 ‘Monks, in whatever former life the Tathagāta,...
rejecting idle chatter, spoke at the right time, what was correct and to the point, of Dhamma and discipline, and what was bound up with profit,...
on returning to earth 
he acquired this mark of the Great Man: 
(22) jaws like a lion’s.
‘Being endowed with this mark,... 
as a ruler 
he cannot be overcome by any human foe or opponent. 

As a Buddha 
he cannot be overcome by any foe or hostile thing from within or without, by lust, hatred or delusion, by any ascetic or Brahmin, deva, mara, Brahmā or anything in the world.’ 

This was what the Lord declared.
^n239 About this it was said:
‘No idle talk or foolishness, 
Fruit of scatterbrain was his. 
Harmful things he put aside, 
Speaking only all menʹs good. 
And so at death he went to heaven 
To taste the fruit of deeds well done. 
Returned to earth once more, his jaw 
Resembled that of him that’s lord 
Of all twice-two-footed things. 
“He will be a king unbeaten,

Like the greatest of the gods.

All the quarters of the world.ʺʹ^f237 
^n240 ‘Monks, in whatever former life the Tathāgata,... 
rejecting wrong livelihood, lived by right livelihood, refraining from cheating with false weights and measures, from bribery and corruption, deception and insincerity, from wounding, killing, imprisoning, lighway robbery, and taking goods by force.^f238

On returning to earth 
he acquired these two marks of the Great Man: (24) even teeth, and (26) very bright canine teeth.
‘Being endowed with these marks, if he keeps to the household life he will be a wheel-turning monarch...
As a ruler, his followers... 
Brahmin householders... 
will be pure.
‘But if he goes forth from the household life into homelessness,... as a Buddha, his followers... 





monks, nuns... 
will be pure.’ 
This was what the Lord declared.
^n241 About this it was said:
‘Wrongful living he gave up 
And took a pure and righteous course. 
Harmful things he cast aside, 
Working only for folk’s good. 
Heaven brings him sweet reward 
For deeds he’s done that earn the praise 
Of those who’re wise and skilled: 
He shares in all delights and joys 
Like the lord of threefold heaven. 
Falling thence to human state, 
As residue of virtue’s fruit, 
He gains evenness of teeth, 
Purity and brightness too. 
Assembled augurs thus declared 
He’ll be the wisest of mankind, ʺ
And pure his followers will be, 
Whose even teeth like birds’ plumes shine. 
As king his pure retainers will 
Bow to his, their lord’s, command. 
Not oppressed by force, they will 
Strive for general weal and joy. 
But if he dwells, a wanderer, 
Free from evil, all lust quenched, 
Drawing back the veil;^f239 with pain 
And weariness all gone, he’ll see 
This world and the next, and there 
Lay-folk and renounced, who flock 
To cast aside, as he has taught, 
Those impure, evil things he blames. 
Thus his followers are pure, 
For he drives out from their hearts Evil and corrupting states.“’
^ck#d31(^h[ Advice to Lay People] )^n242 THUS HAVE I HEARD. 
Once the Lord was staying at Rajagaha, at the Squirrels’ Feeding Place in the Bamboo Grove. 
And at that time Sigalaka the householder’s son, having got up early and gone out of Rajagaha, was paying homage, with wet clothes and hair and with joined palms, to the different directions: 
to the east, the south, the west, the north, the nadir and the zenith.
^n243 And the Lord, having risen early and dressed, took his robe and bowl and went to Rajagaha for alms. 
And seeing Sigalaka paying homage to the different directions, 
he said: 

‘Householderʹs son, why have you got up early to pay homage to the different directions?’ 

‘Lord, my father, when he was dying, told me to do so. 

And so, Lord, out of respect for my father’s words, which I revere, honour and hold sacred, I have got up thus early to pay homage in this way to 
the six directions.’ 
^n244 ‘But, householder’s son, that is not the right way to pay homage to the six directions according to the Ariyan discipline.’ 
‘Well, Lord, how should one pay homage to the six directions according to the Ariyan discipline? 
It would be good if the Blessed Lord were to teach me the proper way to pay homage to the six directions according to the Ariyan discipline.
‘ ‘Then listen carefully, pay attention, and I will speak.’ 
‘Yes, Lord’, said Sigalaka, 
and the Lord said:
‘Young householder, it is by abandoning the four defilements of action,^f240 by not doing evil from the four causes, by not following the six ways of wasting one’s substance ^f241 - through avoiding these fourteen evil ways — that the Ariyan disciple covers the six directions, 
and by such practice becomes a conqueror of both worlds, so that all will go well with him in this world and the next, 
and at the breaking-up of the body after death he will go to a good destiny, a heavenly world.‘What are the four defilements of action that are abandoned? 
^n245 These are the four defilements of action that he abandons.’ 
Thus the Lord spoke.


And the Well-Farer having spoken, the Teacher added:^f242  
‘Taking life and stealing, 
lying, Adultery, 
the wise reprove.

^n246 ‘What are the four causes of evil from which he refrains? 
Evil action springs from attachment, it springs from ill-will, it springs from folly, it springs from fear. 
If the Ariyan disciple does not act out of attachment, ill-will, folly or fear, 
he will not do evil from any one of the four causes.’ 
Thus the Lord spoke.
And the Well-Farer having spoken, the Teacher added:
ʹDesire and hatred, fear and folly: 
He who breaks the law through these, 
Loses all his fair repute 
Like the moon at waning-time.  
Desire and hatred, fear and folly, 
He who never yields to these 
Grows in goodness and repute 
Like the moon at waxing-time.
^n247 ‘And which are the six ways of wasting one’s substance that he does not follow? 
Addiction to strong drink and sloth-producing drugs is one way of wasting one’s substance, haunting the streets at unfitting times is one, attending fairs is one, being addicted to gambling is one, keeping bad company is one, habitual idleness is one.
^n248 ‘There are these six dangers attached to addiction to strong drink and sloth-producing drugs: 
present waste of money, increased quarrelling, liability to sickness, loss of good name, indecent exposure of one’s person, and weakening of the intellect.

^n249 ‘There are these six dangers attached to haunting the streets at unfitting times: 
one is defenceless and without protection, and so are one’s wife and children, and so is one’s property; one is suspected of crimes,^f243 and false reports are pinned on one, and one encounters all sorts of unpleasantness.

^n250 ‘There are these six dangers attached to frequenting fairs: 
〔One is always thinking:〕 “Where is there dancing? Where is there singing? Where are they playing music? Where are they reciting? Where is there hand-clapping?^f244 Where are the drums?”

^n251 ‘There are these six dangers attached to gambling: 
the winner makes enemies, the loser bewails his loss, one wastes one’s present wealth, one’s word is not trusted in the assembly, one is despised by one’s friends and companions, one is not in demand for marriage,^f245 
because a gambler cannot afford to maintain a wife.

^n252 ‘There are these six dangers attached to keeping bad company: 
any gambler, any glutton, any drunkard, any cheat, any trickster, any bully is his friend, his companion. 

^n253 ‘There are these six dangers attached to idleness: 
Thinking: “It’s too cold”, one does not work; thinking: “It’s too hot”, one does not work; thinking: “It’s too early”, one does not work; thinking: “It’s too late”, one does not work; thinking: “I’m too hungry”, one does not work; thinking: “I’m too full”, one does not work.’ 


Thus the Lord spoke.
And the Well-Farer having spoken, the Teacher added:
‘Some are drinking-mates, and some
 Profess their friendship to your face, 
But those who are your friends in need, 
They alone are friends indeed.  
Sleeping late, adultery, 
Picking quarrels, doing harm, 
Evil friends and stinginess, 
These six things destroy a man.  
He who goes with wicked friends 
And spends his time in wicked deeds, 
In this world and the next as well 
That man will come to suffer woe.
 Dicing, wenching, drinking too, 
Dancing, singing, daylight sleep, 
Untimely prowling, evil friends 
And stinginess destroy a man. 
He plays with dice and drinks strong drink 
And goes with others’ well-loved wives. 
He takes the lower, baser course, 
And fades away like waning moon.
 The drunkard, broke and destitute, 
Ever thirsting as he drinks, 
Like stone in water sinks in debt, 
Soon bereft of all his kin.
 He who spends his days in sleep, 
And makes the night his waking-time, 
Ever drunk and lecherous, 
Cannot keep a decent home.
 “Too cold! Too hot! 
Too late!” they cry, 
Thus pushing all their work aside, Till every chance they might have had 
Of doing good has slipped away.
 But he who reckons cold and heat 
As less than straws, and like a man 
Undertakes the task in hand, 
His joy will never grow the less.^f246
^n254 ʹHouseholderʹs son, there are these four types who can be seen as foes in friendly guise: the man who is all take is one, 
the great talker is one, the flatterer is one, and the fellow-spendthrift is one.
^n255 ‘The man who is all take can be seen to be a false friend for four reasons: 
he takes everything, 
he wants a lot for very little, 
what he must do he does out of fear, 
and he seeks his own ends.

^n256 ‘The great talker can be seen to be a false friend for four reasons: 
he talks of favours in the past, and in the future, he mouths empty phrases of goodwill, and when something needs to be done in the present, he pleads inability owing to some disaster.^f247

^n257 ‘The flatterer can be seen to be a false friend for four reasons: 
he assents to bad actions, he dissents from good actions, he praises you to your face, and he disparages you behind your back.

^n258 ‘The fellow-spendthrift can be seen to be a false friend for four reasons: 
he is a companion when you indulge in strong drink, when you haunt the streets at unfitting times, when you frequent fairs, and when you indulge in gambling.’ 

^n259  Thus the Lord spoke.
And the Well-Farer having spoken, the Teacher added:
‘The friend who seeks what he can get, 
The friend who talks but empty words, 
The friend who merely flatters you, 
The friend who is a fellow-wastrel: 
These four are really foes, not friends. 
The wise man, recognising this, 
Should hold himself aloof from them 
As from some path of panic fear. 
^n260 ‘Householderʹs son, there are these four types who can be seen to be loyal^f248 friends: 
the friend who is a helper is one, the friend who is the same in happy and unhappy times is one, the friend who points out what is good for you is one, and the friend who is sympathetic is one.
^n261 ‘The helpful friend can be seen to be a loyal friend in four ways: 
he looks after you when you are inattentive,^f249 he looks after your possessions when you are inattentive, he is a refuge when you are afraid, and when some business is to be done he lets you have twice what you ask for.

^n262 ‘The friend who is the same in happy and unhappy times can be seen to be a loyal friend in four ways: 
he tells you his secrets, he guards your secrets, he does not let you down in misfortune, he would even sacrifice his life for you.

^n263 ‘The friend who points out what is good for you can be seen to be a loyal friend in four ways: 
he keeps you from wrongdoing, he supports you in doing good, he informs you of what you did not know, and he points out the path to heaven.

^n264 ‘The sympathetic friend can be seen to be a loyal friend in four ways: 
he does not rejoice at your misfortune, he rejoices at your good fortune, he stops others who speak against you, and he commends others who speak in praise of you.’ 

^n265  Thus the Lord spoke.
And the Well-Farer having spoken thus, the Teacher added: 
‘The friend who is a helper and 
The friend in times both good and bad, 
The friend who shows the way that’s right, 
The friend who’s full of sympathy: 
These four kinds of friends the wise 
Should know at their true worth, and he 
Should cherish them with care, just like 
A mother with her dearest child.
  The wise man trained and disciplined 
Shines out like a beacon-fire. 
He gathers wealth just as the bee 
Gathers honey, 
and it grows 
Like an ant-hill higher yet. 
With wealth so gained the layman can 
Devote it to his people’s good.
  He should divide his wealth in four
 (This will most advantage bring). 
One part he may enjoy at will, 
Two parts he should put to work, 
The fourth part he should set aside 
As reserve in times of need.
^n266 ‘And how, householder’s son, does the Ariyan disciple protect the six directions? 
These six things are to be regarded as the six directions. 
The east denotes mother and father. The south denotes teachers,^f250 The west denotes wife and children. The north denotes friends and companions. The nadir denotes servants, workers and helpers. The zenith denotes ascetics and Brahmins.
^n267 ‘There are five ways in which a son should minister to his mother and father as the eastern direction. 〔He should think:〕 
“Having been supported by them, I will support them. I will perform their duties for them. I will keep up the family tradition. I will be worthy of my heritage. After my parents’ deaths I will distribute gifts on their behalf.ʺ^f251 
And there are five ways in which the parents, so ministered to by their son as the eastern direction, will reciprocate: 
they will restrain him from evil, support him in doing good, teach him some skill, find him a suitable wife and, in due time, hand over his inheritance to him. 
In this way the eastern direction is covered, making it at peace and free from fear.

^n268 ‘There are five ways in which pupils should minister to their teachers as the southern direction: 
by rising to greet them, by waiting on them, by being attentive, by serving them, by mastering the skills they teach. 
And there are five ways in which their teachers, thus ministered to by their pupils as the southern direction, will reciprocate: 
they will give thorough instruction, make sure they have grasped what they should have duly grasped, give them a thorough grounding in all skills, recommend them to their friends and colleagues, and provide them with security in all directions. 
In this way the southern direction is covered, making it at peace and free from fear.

^n269 ‘There are five ways in which a husband should minister to his wife as the western direction: 
by honouring her, by not disparaging her, by not being unfaithful to her, by giving authority to her, by providing her with adornments. 
And there are five ways in which a wife, thus ministered to by her husband as the western direction, will reciprocate: 
by properly organising her work, by being kind to the servants, by not being unfaithful, by protecting stores, and by being skilful and diligent in all she has to do. 
In this way the western direction is covered, making it at peace and free from fear.

^n270 ‘There are five ways in which a man should minister to his friends and companions as the northern direction: 
by gifts, by kindly words, by looking after their welfare, by treating them like himself, and by keeping his word. 
And there are five ways in which friends and companions, thus ministered to by a man as the northern direction, will reciprocate: 
by looking after him when he is inattentive, by looking after his property when he is inattentive, by being a refuge when he is afraid, by not deserting him when he is in trouble, and by showing concern for his children. 
In this way the northern direction is covered, making it at peace and free from fear.

^n271 ‘There are five ways in which a master^f252 should minister to his servants and workpeople as the nadir: 
by arranging their work according to their strength, by supplying them with food and wages, by looking after them when they are ill, by sharing special delicacies with them, and by letting them off work at the right time. 
And there are five ways in which servants and workpeople, thus ministered to by their master as the nadir, will reciprocate: 
they will get up before him, go to bed after him, take only what they are given, do their work properly, and be bearers of his praise and good repute. 
In this way the nadir is covered, making it at peace and free from fear.

^n272 ‘There are five ways in which a man should minister to ascetics and Brahmins as the zenith: 
by kindness in bodily deed, speech and thought, by keeping open house for them, by supplying their bodily needs. 
And the ascetics and Brahmins, thus ministered to by him as the zenith, will reciprocate in six ways: 
they will restrain him from evil, encourage him to do good, be benevolently compassionate towards him, teach him what he has not heard, clarify what he has heard, and point out to him the way to heaven. 
In this way the zenith is covered, making it at peace and free from frear.’ 

^n273  Thus the Lord spoke.
And the Well-Farer having spoken, the Teacher added:
‘Mother, father are the east, 
Teachers are the southward point, 
Wife and children are the west, 
Friends and colleagues are the north. 
Servants and workers are below, 
Ascetics, Brahmins are above. 
These directions all should be 
Honoured by a clansman true. 
He who’s wise and disciplined, 
Kindly and intelligent, 
Humble, free from pride, 
Such a one may honour gain. 
Early rising, scorning sloth, 
Unshaken by adversity, 
Of faultless conduct, ready wit, 
Such a one may honour gain. 
Making friends, and keeping them, 
Welcoming, no stingy host, 
A guide, philosopher and friend, 
Such a one may honour gain. 
Giving gifts and kindly speech, 
A life well-spent for others’ good, 
Even-handed in all things, 
Impartial as each case demands: 
These things make the world go round 
Like the chariot’s axle-pin. 
If such things did not exist, 
No mother from her son would get 
Any honour and respect, 
Nor father either, as their due. 
But since these qualities are held 
By the wise in high esteem, 
They are given prominence 
And are rightly praised by all.’
^n274 At these words Sigālaka said to the Lord: 
‘Excellent, Reverend Gotama, excellent! 
It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there. 
Just so the Reverend Gotama has expounded the Dhamma in various ways, 
May the Reverend Gotama accept me as a lay-follower from this day forth as long as life shall last!’

^ck#d32(^z1[Āṭānāṭiya Sutta: The Āṭānātā Protective Verses] )^n275 THUS HAVE I HEARD.^f253 
Once the Lord was staying at Rajagaha on Vultures’ Peak. 
And the Four Great Kings,^f254 with a great array of yakkhas, of gandhabbas, of kumbhandas and of nagas,^f255 having set up a guard, a defensive force, a watch over the four quarters,^f256 as night was drawing to a close, went to see the Lord, lighting up the entire Vultures’ Peak with their radiance, saluted him and sat down to one side. 
And some of the yakkhas saluted him and sat down to one side, some exchanged courtesies with him before sitting down, same saluted him with joined palms, some announced their name and clan, and some sat down in silence.^f257
^n276 Then sitting to one side, King Vessavana^f258 said to the Lord: 
‘Lord, there are some prominent yakkhas who have no faith in the Blessed Lord, 
and others who have faith; 
and likewise there are yakkhas of middle 
and lower rank who have no faith in the Blessed Lord, 
and others who have faith. 

But, Lord, the majority of yakkhas have no faith in the Blessed Lord. 
Why is this? 
The Blessed Lord teaches a code of refraining from taking life, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from lying speech, and from strong drink and sloth-producing drugs. 
But the majority of the yakkhas do not refrain from these things, 
and to do so is distasteful and unpleasant to them. 
Now, Lord, there are disciples of the Blessed Lord who dwell in remote forest glades, where there is little noise or shouting, far from the madding crowd, hidden from people, suitable for retreat. 
And there are prominent yakkhas living there who have no faith in the word of the Blessed Lord. 
In order to give these folk confidence, may the Blessed Lord leam^f259 the Āṭānāṭā protective verses, by means of which monks and nuns, male and female lay-followers may dwell guarded, protected, unharmed and at their ease?’ 
And the Lord consented by silence.
Then King Vessavana, noting the Lord’s consent, at once recited these Āṭānāṭā protective verses:
^n277 ‘Glory be to Vipassī,^f260
The splendid one of mighty vision. 
Glory be to Sikhī too, 
The compassionate to all. 
Glory be to Vessabhū, 
Bathed in pure asceticism.^f261
 To Kakusandha glory be, 
Victor over Māra’s host. 
To Konāgamana glory too, 
Brahmin fully perfect he. 
Glory be to Kassapa, 
Liberated every way, 
Glory to Angirasa, 
To the Sakyas’ radiant son,^f262
Teacher of the Dhamma he 
That overcomes all suffering. 
And they who from this world are freed,^f263
Seeing to the heart of things, 
They who are so mild of speech, 
Mighty and of wisdom too, 
To him who helps both gods and men, 
To Gotama they offer praise: 
In wisdom trained, in conduct too, 
Mighty and resourceful too.
^n278 ‘The point from where the sun comes up, 
Aditya’s child, in mighty arc, 
At whose arising shrouding night 
Is dispelled and vanishes, 
So that with the risen sun 
There comes to be what folk call 
Day, There too this moving watery mass, 
The deep and mighty ocean swells, 
This men know, and this they call 
Ocean or The Swelling Sea. 
This quarter is the East, or First:^f264
That is how the people call it. 
This quarter’s guarded by a king, 
Mighty in power and fame is he, 
Lord of all the gandhabbas. 
Dhatarattha is his name, 
Honoured by the gandhabbas. 
Their songs and dances he enjoys. 
He has many mighty sons, 
Eighty, ten and one, they say, 
And all with but a single name, 
Called after Indra, lord of strength. 
And when the Buddha greets their gaze, 
Buddha, kinsman of the Sun, 
From afar they offer homage 
To the Lord of wisdom true: 
“Hail, o man of noble race! 
Hail to you, the first of men! 
In kindness you have looked on us, 
Who, though not human, honour you! 
Often asked, do we revere 
Gotama the Conqueror? 
— We reply: 
‘We do revere Gotama, great 
Conqueror, In wisdom trained, in conduct too,

^n279 ‘Where they whom men call petas^f265 dwell,

^n281 ‘Where lovely Northern Kuru lies, 
Under mighty Neru fair, 
There men dwell, a happy race,^f267
Possessionless, not owning wives.^f268
They have no need to scatter seed, 
They have no need to draw the plough: 
Of itself the ripened crop 
Presents itself for men to eat. 
Free from powder and from husk, 
Sweet of scent, the finest rice, 
Boiling on hot oven-stones,^f269
Such the food that they enjoy. 
The ox their single-seated mount,^f270
Thus they ride about the land. 


Using women as a mount, 
Thus they ride about the land;^f271
Using men to serve as mount, 
Thus they ride about the land; 
Using maidens as a mount, 
Thus they ride about the land; 
Using boys to serve as mount, 
Thus they ride about the land. 
And so, carried by such mounts, 
All the region they traverse 
In the service of their king. 
Elephants they ride, and horses too, 
Cars fit for gods they have as well. 
Splendid palanquins are there 
For the royal retinue. 
Cities too they have, well-built, 
Soaring up into the skies: 
Āṭānāṭā, Kusināṭā, Parakusināṭā, 
Nāṭapuriya is theirs, And Parakusitanāṭā.

There’s the mighty water Dharani, 
Source of rain-clouds which pour down 
When the rainy season comes. 
Bhagalavati’s there, the hall 
That is the yakkhas’ meeting-place, 
Round it ever-fruiting trees 
Full of many kinds of birds, 
Where peacocks scream and herons cry, 
And the cuckoo gently calls. 
The ^i[jīva-bird] who cries: 
“Live on!”^f274
And he that sings: 
“Lift up your hearts!”^f275
 The pheasant-cock, ^i[kulīraka,]^f276
The forest-crane, the rice-bird too, 
And ^i[mynah]-birds that mimic man, 
And those whose name is “men on stilts”. 
And there for ever beauteous lies 
Fair Kuvera’s lotus-lake. 
This quarter is the North, they say: 
That is how the people call it. 
This quarter’s guarded by a king, 
Mighty in power and fame is he, 
Lord of all the yakkha folk, And Kuvera is his name. 
Honoured by the yakkha folk, 
Their songs and dances he enjoys. 
He has many mighty sons, 
Eighty, ten and one, they say, 
And all with but a single name, Called after Indra, lord of strength. 
And when the Buddha greets their gaze,

‘These, sir, are the Āṭānāṭā protective verses, by means of which monks and nuns, male and female lay-followers may dwell guarded, protected, unharmed and at ease. 
^n282 If any monk or nun, male or female lay-follower learns these verses well and has them off by heart, 
then if any non-human being, male or female yakkha or yakkha-offspring, or a chief attendant or servant of the yakkhas, any male or female gandhabba, ... kumbhanda, ... nāga,... 
should approach that person with hostile intent while he or she is walking or starting to walk, standing or rising to stand, seated or sitting down, lying down or starting to lie down, that non-human being would not gain any honour or respect in village or town. 
Such a being would not gain a footing or a lodging in my royal city of Alakamanda, 
he would not be admitted to the yakkhas’ assembly, 
nor would he be acceptable for taking or giving in marriage. 
And all the non-human beings, full of rage, would overwhelm him with abuse. 
Then they would bend down his head like an empty bowl, 
and they would split his skull into seven pieces.^f277
‘There are, sir, some non-human beings who are fierce, wild and terrible. 
They heed neither the Great Kings, nor their officers, nor their attendants. 
They are said to be in revolt against the Great Kings. 
Just as the bandit-chiefs whom the King of Magadha has overcome do not heed him, or his officers, or their attendants, so too do they behave. 
Now if any yakkha or yakkha-offspring, ... 
gandhabba, ... 

should approach any monk, nun, male or female lay-follower...
with hostile intent, that person should alarm, call out and shout to those yakkhas, the great yakkhas, their commanders and commanders-in-chief, saying: 
“This yakkha has seized me, has hurt me, harmed me, injured me, and will not let me go!”
^n283 ‘Which are the yakkhas, the great yakkhas, their commanders and commanders-in-chief? They are:
Inda, Soma, Varuna,

Devasuta, Matali,

These are the yakkhas, great yakkhas, their commanders and commanders-in-chief who should be called upon in case of such an attack.

‘And these, sir, are the Āṭānāṭā protective verses by means of which monks and nuns, male and female lay-followers may dwell guarded, protected, unharmed and at ease. 
And now, sir, we must go: we have many duties, many things to do.’ 
‘Do so, Kings, when you think fit.’
^n284 And the Four Great Kings stood up, saluted the Lord, passed by on his right side, and vanished. 
And the yakkhas stood up, and some saluted the Lord, passed by on his right, and vanished, some exchanged courtesies with the Lord, some saluted him with joined palms, some announced their name and clan, some remained silent, and they all vanished.

^n285 And when the night was over, the Lord said to the monks:

They are for your benefit, and through them monks and nuns, male and female lay-followers may dwell guarded, protected, unharmed and at ease.’
 Thus the Lord spoke. 
And the monks were delighted and rejoiced at his words.

^ck#d33(^z1[Sangīti Sutta: The Chanting Together] )^n296 THUS HAVE I HEARD. 
Once the Lord was touring in the Malla country with a large company of about five hundred monks. 
Arrived at Pāvā, the Mallas’ capital, he stayed in the mango-grove of Cunda the smith.^f279
^n297 Now at that time a new meeting-hall of the Mallas of Pāvā, called Ubbhaṭaka,^f280 had recently been built, and it had not yet been occupied by any ascetic or Brahmin, or indeed by any human being. 
Hearing that the Lord was staying in Cunda’s mango-grove, the Mallas of Pāvā went to see him. 
Having saluted him, they sat down to one side and said: 
‘Lord, the Mallas of Pāvā have recently erected a new meeting-hall called Ubbhataka, and it has not yet been occupied by any ascetic or Brahmin, or indeed by any human being. 
May the Blessed Lord be the first to use it! 
Should he do so, that would be for the lasting good and happiness of the Mallas of Pāvā.′ 
And the Lord consented by silence.
^n298 Noting his assent, the Mallas rose, saluted him, passed out to his right and went to the meeting-hall. They spread mats all round, arranged seats, put out a water-pot and an oil-lamp, 
and then, returning to the Lord, saluted him, sat down to one side 
and reported what they had done, saying: 

‘Whenever the Blessed Lord is ready.’
^n299 Then the Lord dressed, took his robe and bowl, and went to the meeting-hall with his monks. There he washed his feet, entered the hall and sat down against the central pillar, facing east. 
The monks, having washed their feet, entered the hall and sat down along the western wall facing east, with the Lord in front of them. 
The Pāvā Mallas washed their feet, entered the hall, and sat down along the eastern wall facing west, with the Lord in front of them. 
Then the Lord spoke to the Mallas on Dhamma till far into the night, instructing, inspiring, firing and delighting them. 
Then he dismissed them, saying: ‘Vāsetthas,^f281 the night has passed away.^f282
 Now do as you think fit.’ 
‘Very good, Lord’, replied the Mallas. And they got up, saluted the Lord, and went out, passing him by on the right.
^n300 As soon as the Mallas had gone the Lord, surveying the monks sitting silently all about, said to the Venerable Sāriputta: 
‘The monks are free from sloth-and-torpor,^f283 Sāriputta. 
You think of a discourse on Dhamma to give to them. 
My back aches, 
I want to stretch it.’ 
‘Very good, Lord’, replied Sāriputta. 
Then the Lord, having folded his robe in four, lay down on his right side in the lion-posture,^f284 with one foot on the other, mindful and clearly aware, and bearing in mind the time to arise.
^n301 Now at that time the Nigantha Nātaputta had just died at Pāvā. 
And at his death the Niganthas were split into two parties, quarrelling and disputing... 
(^i[as Sutta 29, verse 1]). 
You would have thought they were bent on killing each other. 
Even the white-robed lay followers were disgusted when they saw that their doctrine and discipline was so ill-proclaimed,... having been proclaimed by one not fully-enlightened and now with its support gone, without an arbiter.
^n302 And the Venerable Sāriputta addressed the monks, referring to this situation, and said: 


‘So ill-proclaimed was their teaching and discipline, so unedifyingly displayed, and so ineffectual in calming the passions, having been proclaimed by one who was not fully enlightened. 
But, friends, this Dhamma has been well proclaimed by the Lord, the fully-enlightened One. 
And so we should all recite it together ^f285 without disagreement, so that this holy life may be enduring and established for a long time, thus to be for the welfare and happiness of the multitude, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare and happiness of devas and humans. 
And what is this Dhamma that has been well proclaimed by the Lord...?

So we should all recite together...for the benefit, welfare and happiness of devas and humans.’ 
^n306 ‘There are 〔sets of〕 four things which were perfectly proclaimed by the Lord... 


(1) ‘Four foundations of mindfulness: 
Here a monk abides contemplating body as body, ardent, clearly aware and mindful, having put aside hankering and fretting for the world; 
he abides contemplating feelings as feelings...; 
he abides contemplating mind as mind...; 
he abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects, ardent, clearly aware and mindful, having put aside hankering and fretting for the world. 
(2) ‘Four great efforts (^i[sammappadhānā]): 
Here a monk rouses his will, makes an effort, stirs up energy, exerts his mind and strives to prevent the arising of unarisen evil unwholesome mental states. 
He rouses his will... and strives to overcome evil unwholesome mental states that have arisen. 
He rouses his will...and strives to produce unarisen wholesome mental states. 
He rouses his will...and strives to maintain wholesome mental states that have arisen, not to let them fade away, to bring them to greater growth, to the full perfection of development. 
(3) ‘Four roads to power (^i[iddhipādā]): 
Here a monk develops concentration of intention accompanied by effort of will, 
concentration of energy,... 
concentration of consciousness, 
and concentration of investigation accompanied by effort of will. 
(4) ‘Four jhānas: 
Here a monk, detached from all sense-desires, detached from unwholesome mental states, enters and remains in the first jhāna, which is with thinking and pondering, born of detachment, filled with delight and joy. 
And with the subsiding of thinking and pondering, by gaining inner tranquillity and oneness of mind, he enters and remains in the second jhāna, which is without thinking and pondering, born of concentration, filled with delight and joy. 
And with the fading away of delight, remaining imperturbable, mindful and clearly aware, he experiences in himself that joy of which the Noble Ones say: “Happy is he who dwells with equanimity and mindfulness”, he enters and remains in the third jhāna. 
And, having given up pleasure and pain, and with the disappearance of former gladness and sadness, he enters and remains in the fourth jhāna which is beyond pleasure and pain, and purified by equanimity and mindfulness.
^n307 (5) ‘Four concentrative meditations (^i[samādhi-bhāvanā]). 
This meditation, when developed and expanded, leads to (a) happiness here and now (^i[ditthadhamma-sukha]), 
(b) gaining knowledge-and-vision (^i[ñāṇa-dassana-paṭilābha]), 
(c) mindfulness and clear awareness (^i[sati]-^i[sampajañña]), 
and (d) the destruction of the corruptions (^i[āsavānaṁ khaya]). 
(a) How does this practice lead to happiness here and now? 
Here, a monk practises the four jhānas. 



(b) How does it lead to the gaining of knowledge-and-vision? 
Here, a monk attends to the perception of light (^i[ālokasaññaṁ manasikaroti]), he fixes his mind to the perception of day, by night as by day, by day as by night. 

In this way, with a mind clear and unclouded, he develops a state of mind that is full of brightness (^i[sappabhāsam cittaṁ]). 
(c) How does it lead to mindfulness and clear awareness? 
Here, a monk knows feelings as they arise, remain and vanish; 
he knows perceptions as they arise, remain and vanish; 
he knows thoughts (^i[vitakkā])^f324 as they arise, remain and vanish. 

(d) How does this practice lead to the destruction of the corruptions? 
Here, a monk abides in the contemplation of the rise and fall of the five aggregates of grasping ^i[(pañc’upādānakkhandesu udayabbayânupassi]): 
“This is material form, this is its arising, this is its ceasing; 
these are feelings...; 
this is perception...; 
these are the mental formations...; 
this is consciousness, this is its arising, this is its ceasing.”

^n308 (6) ‘Four boundless states. 
Here, a monk, with a heart filled with loving-kindness, pervades first one quarter, then the second, the third and the fourth. Thus he stays, spreading the thought of loving-kindness above, below and across, everywhere, always with a heart filled with loving-kindness, abundant, magnified, unbounded, without hatred or ill-will. 
And likewise with compassion, 
sympathetic joy, 
and equanimity.
  (7) ‘Four formless jhānas. 
Here, a monk, by passing entirely beyond bodily sensations, by the disappearance of all sense of resistance and by non-attraction to the perception of diversity, seeing that space is infinite, reaches and remains in the Sphere of Infinite Space. 
And by passing entirely beyond the Sphere of Infinite Space, seeing that consciousness is infinite, he reaches and remains in the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness. 
And by passing entirely beyond the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness, seeing that there is no thing, he reaches and remains in the Sphere of No-Thingness. 
And by passing entirely beyond the Sphere of No-Thingness, he reaches and remains in the Sphere of Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception.
(8) ‘Four supports ^f325^i[(apassenāni):]
 Here a monk judges that one thing is to be pursued, one thing endured, one thing avoided, one thing suppressed.
^n309 (9) ‘Four Ariyan lineages ^i[(ariya-υaṁsā).] 
Here, a monk (a) is content with any old robe, praises such contentment, and does not try to obtain robes improperly or unsuitably. He does not worry if he does not get a robe, and if he does, he is not full of greedy, blind desire, but makes use of it, aware of 〔such〕 dangers and wisely aware of its true purpose. Nor is he conceited about being thus content with any old robe, and he does not disparage others. 
And one who is thus skilful, not lax, clearly aware and mindful, is known as a monk who is true to the ancient, original ^i[(aggaññe)] Ariyan lineage. 
Again, (b) a monk is content with any alms-food he may get... 

Again, (c) a monk is content with any old lodging-place ... 

And again, (d) a monk, being fond of abandoning ^i[( pahāna),] rejoices in abandoning, and being fond of developing ^i[(bhāυanā),] rejoices in developing, is not therefore conceited... 
And one who is thus skilful, not lax, clearly aware and mindful, is known as a monk who is true to the ancient, original Ariyan lineage.
^n310 (10) ‘Four efforts: 
The effort of (a) restraint ^i[(saṁυara-padhānaṁ),] (b) abandoning ^i[(pahāna-p.),] (c) development ^i[(bhāυanāp.] ), (d) preservation ^i[(anurakkhana-p.).]
 What is (a) the effort of restraint? 
Here, a monk, on seeing an object with the eye, does not grasp at the whole or its details, 
striving to restrain what might cause evil, unwholesome states, such as hankering or sorrow, to flood in on him. 
Thus he watches over the sense of sight and guards it ^i[(similarly with] sounds, 
smells, 
tastes, 
tactile sensations, 
thoughts). 


 What is (b) the effort of abandoning? 
Here, a monk does not assent to a thought of lust, 
of hatred, 
of cruelty that has arisen, but abandons it, dispels it, destroys it, makes it disappear. 


What is (c) the effort of development? 
Here, a monk develops the enlightenment-factor of mindfulness, based on solitude, detachment, extinction, leading to maturity of surrender ^i[(vossagga-parināmiṁ);] 
he develops the enlightenment-factor of investigation of states, ... 
of energy, ... 
of delight, ... 
of tranquillity, ... 
of concentration, ... 
of equanimity, based on solitude, detachment, extinction, leading to maturity of surrender. 

What is (d) the effort of preservation? 
Here, a monk keeps firmly in his mind a favourable object of concentration which has arisen, such as a skeleton, or a corpse that is full of worms, blue-black, full of holes, bloated.

 (11) ‘Four knowledges: 
knowledge of Dhamma, of what is consonant with it ^i[(anvaye ñānaṁ),] knowledge of others’ minds^f326^i[(paricce ñānaṁ),] conventional knowledge^f327^i[(sammuti-ñānaṁ).]
(12) ‘Four more knowledges:

 (14) ‘Four characteristics of a Stream-Winner: 
Here, the Ariyan disciple is possessed of unwavering confidence in the Buddha, thus: 
“This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, the Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teachers of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed.” 
(b) He is possessed of unwavering confidence in the Dhamma, thus: 
“Well-proclaimed by the Lord is the Dhamma, visible here and now, timeless, inviting inspection, leading onward, to be comprehended by the wise each one for himself.” 
(c) He is possessed of unwavering confidence in the Sangha, thus: 
“Well-directed is the Sangha of the Lord’s disciples, of upright conduct, on the right path, on the perfect path; that is to say the four pairs of persons, the eight kinds of men. The Sangha of the Lord’s disciples is worthy of offerings, worthy of hospitality, worthy of gifts, worthy of veneration, an unsurpassed field of merit in the world.” 
And (d) he is possessed of morality dear to the Noble Ones, unbroken, without defect, unspotted, without inconsistency, liberating, praised by the wise, uncorrupted, and conducive to concentration.

the elements of “earth”, “water”, “fire”, “air” ^i[(pathaυῑ-, āpo-, tejo-, vāyo-dhātu).]
(17) ‘Four nutriments ^i[(āhārā):] “material”^f328
^i[(kabalinkāra)] food, gross or subtle; ^f329 contact as second; mental volition ^i[(manosañcetanā)]1063 as third; consciousness as fourth.
(18) ‘Four stations of consciousness (^i[viññāna-tthitiyo]): 
Consciousness gains a footing either (a) in relation to materiality, with materiality as object and basis, as a place of enjoyment, or similarly in regard to 
(b) feelings, 
(c) perceptions or 
(d) mental formations, and there it grows, increases and flourishes.

(b) is in good health, suffers little distress or sickness, having a good digestion that is neither too cool nor too hot but of a middling temperature suitable for exertion,

^n319 (19) ‘Five mental blockages (^i[ceto-khīlā]):

And he gets this thought well-set, well-developed, well raised up, well freed and disconnected from sense-desires. 
And thus he is freed from the corruptions (^i[āsavā]), the vexations and fevers that arise from sense-desires, and he does not feel that 〔sensual〕 feeling. 
This is called the deliverance from sense-desires.

has well considered it, applied his mind to it ^i[(supadhāritaṁ),] and has well penetrated it with wisdom ^i[(suppaṭividdhaṁ paññāya).]
 At this, joy arises in him, and from this joy, delight; and by this delight his senses are calmed, he feels happiness as a result, and with this happiness his mind is established.

Or (c) he has to go on a journey, 
and thinks: 
“I have to go on this journey. It will make me tired ... ”


Or (d) he has been on a journey... 




Or (e) he goes on the alms-round in a village or town and does not get his fill of food, whether coarse or fine, 
and he thinks: 
“I’ve gone for alms... ... my body is tired and useless ... 


Or (f) he goes on the alms-round ... and gets his fill ... 
He thinks: 
”I’ve gone for alms ... 
and my body is heavy and useless as if I were pregnant ... ”^f375 ... 

Or (g) he has developed some slight indisposition, 
and he thinks: 
“I’d better have a rest...” 



Or (h) he is recuperating, having not long recovered from an illness, 
and he thinks: 
“My body is weak and useless. I’ll have a rest.” 
So he lies down and does not stir up enough energy to complete the uncompleted, to accomplish the unaccomplished, to realise the unrealised.

^n335 (5) ‘Eight occasions for making an effort ^i[(ārabbha-vatthūni):]
 Here, a monk (a) has a job to do. 
He thinks: 
“I’ve got this job to do, but in doing it I won’t find it easy to pay attention to the teaching of the Buddhas. So I will stir up sufficient energy to complete the uncompleted, to accomplish the unaccomplished, to realise the unrealised.” 


Or (b) he has done some work, 
and thinks: 
 “Well, I did the job, but because of it I wasn’t able to pay sufficient attention to the teaching of the Buddhas. 
So I will stir up sufficient energy...” 

Or (c) he has to go on a journey...





Or (d) he has been on a journey. 
He thinks: 
“I’ve been on this journey, but because of it I wasn’t able to pay sufficient attention ...” 


Or (e) he goes for alms ... without getting his fill ... 
And he thinks: 
“So my body is light and fit. I’ll stir up energy...” 


Or (f) he goes for alms... and gets his fill ... 
And he thinks: 
“So my body is strong and fit. I’ll stir up energy...” 


Or (g) he has some slight indisposition... 
and he thinks: 
“This indisposition might get worse, so I’ll stir up energy... 


Or (h) he is recuperating... 
and he thinks: 
”...it might be that the illness will recur. So I’ll stir up energy...” 
Thus he stirs up sufficient energy to complete the uncompleted, to accomplish the unaccomplished, to realise the unrealised.

^n336 (6) ‘Eight bases for giving: 
One gives (a) as occasion offers ^i[(āsajja),] (b) from fear, (c) thinking: “He gave me something”, (d) thinking: “He will give me something”, (e) thinking: “It is good to give”, (f) thinking: “I am cooking something, they are not. It would not be right not to give something to those who are not cooking”, (g) thinking: “If I make this gift I shall acquire a good reputation”, (h) in order to adorn and prepare one’s heart.^f376

^n337 (7) ‘Eight kinds of rebirth due to generosity: 
Here, someone gives an ascetic or Brahmin food, drink, clothes, transport ^i[( yānaṁ,] garlands, perfumes and ointments, sleeping accommodation, a dwelling, or lights, 
and he hopes to receive a return for his gifts. 
 He sees a rich Khattiya or Brahmin or householder living in full enjoyment of the pleasures of the five senses, 
and he thinks: 
“If only when I die I may be reborn as one of these rich people!” 
He sets his heart on this thought, fixes it and develops it ^i[(bhāveti).]^f377  And this thought, being launched ^i[(vimuttaṁ)] at such a low level ^i[(hīne),] and not developed to a higher level ^i[(uttarin abhāvitaṁ),] leads to rebirth right there. 
But I say this of a moral person, not of an immoral one. 
The mental aspiration of a moral person is effective through its purity.^f378
 Or (b) he gives such gifts and, 

having heard 
that the devas in the realm of the Four Great Kings live long, are good-looking and lead a happy life, 
he thinks: 
“If only I could be reborn there!” 






Or he similarly aspires to rebirth in the heavens of (c) the Thirty-Three Gods, 
(d) the Yama devas, 
(e) the Tusita devas, 
(f) the Nimmanarati devas, 
(g) the Paranimmita-vasavatti devas. 
And this thought leads to rebirth right there ... 



The mental aspiration of a moral person is effective through its purity. 



Or (h) he similarly aspires to rebirth in the world of Brahmā ... 



But I say this of a moral person, not an immoral one, one freed from passion ^i[(vītarāgassa),] not one still swayed by passion.^f379
 The mental aspiration of 〔such〕 a moral person is effective through liberation from passion.

^n345 ‘There are 〔sets of〕 ten things perfectly proclaimed by the Lord...


(1) ‘Ten things that give protection ^i[(nātha-karana-dhammā):]^f385
 Here a monk (a) is moral, he lives restrained according to the restraint of the discipline, persisting in right behaviour, seeing danger in the slightest fault, he keeps to the rules of training; 


(b) he has learnt much, and bears in mind and retains what he has learnt. In these teachings, beautiful in the beginning, the middle and the ending, which in spirit and in letter proclaim the absolutely perfected and purified holy life, he is deeply learned, he remembers them, recites them, recites them, reflects on them and penetrates them with vision; 


(c) he is a friend, associate and intimate of good people; 


(d) he is affable, endowed with gentleness and patience, quick to grasp instruction; 


(e) whatever various jobs there are to be done for his fellow-monks, he is skilful, not lax, using foresight in carrying them out, and is good at doing and planning; 


(f) he loves the Dhamma and delights in hearing it, he is especially fond of the advanced doctrine and discipline (^i[abhidhamme abhivinaye);]^f386 


(g) he is content with any kind of requisites: 
robes, alms-food, lodging, medicines in case of illness; 

(h) he ever strives to arouse energy, to get rid of unwholesome states, to establish wholesome states, untiringly and energetically striving to keep such good states and never shaking off the burden; 


(i) he is mindful, with a great capacity for clearly recalling things done and said long ago;^f387 


(j) he is wise, with wise perception of arising and passing away, that Ariyan perception that leads to the complete destruction of suffering.


^n346 (2) ‘Ten objects for the attainment of absorption ^i[(kasiṇâyatanāni):]^f388
 He perceives the Earth-Kasina, 
the Water-Kasina, 
the Fire-Kasina, 
the Wind-Kasina, 
the Blue Kasina, 
the Yellow Kasina, 
the Red Kasina, 
the White Kasina, 
the Space-Kasina, 
the Consciousness Kasina,^f389 above, below, on all sides, undivided, unbounded.
^n347 (3) ‘Ten unwholesome courses of action ^i[(akusala-kammapathā):]
 taking life, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, lying speech, slander, rude speech, idle chatter, greed, malevolence, wrong view. 
(4) ‘Ten wholesome courses of action: avoidance of taking life..
^i[.(and so on, as (3) above).]
^n348 (5) ‘Ten Ariyan dispositions ^i[(ariya-vāsā):]
 Here a monk (a) has got rid of five factors, (b) possesses six factors, (c) has established one guard, (d) observes the four supports, (e) has got rid of individual beliefs,^f390 (f) has quite abandoned quest, (g) is pure of motive, (h) has tranquillised his emotions,^f391 is well liberated (i) in heart, and (j) by wisdom. 
How has he got rid of five factors? 
Here, he has got rid of sensuality, ill-will, sloth-and-torpor, worry-and-flurry, and doubt; 

(b) what six factors does he possess? 
On seeing an object with the eye, 
hearing a sound..., smelling a smell..., tasting a flavour... , touching a tangible object..., or cognising a mental object with the mind, 
he is neither pleased nor displeased, but remains equable, mindful and clearly aware; 

(c) how has he established the one guard? 
By guarding his mind with mindfulness; 

(d) what are the four supports? 
He judges that one thing is to be pursued, one thing endured, one thing avoided, one thing suppressed ^i[(as verse 1.11] (8)); 

(e) how has he got rid of individual beliefs ^i[(panunna-pacceka-sacco)?]
 Whatever individual beliefs are held by the majority of ascetics and Brahmins he has dismissed, abandoned, rejected, let go; 

(f) how is he one who has quite abandoned quests? 
He has abandoned the quest for sense-desires, for rebirth, for the holy life;^f392 

(g) how is he pure of motive? 
He has abandoned thoughts of sensuality, ill-will, cruelty; 

(h) how is he one who has tranquillised his emotions ^i[(passaddha-kaya-sankhāro hoti)?]
 Because, having given up pleasure and pain with the disappearance of former gladness and sadness, he enters into a state beyond pleasure and pain which is purified by equanimity, and this is the fourth jhāna; 

(i) how is he well emancipated in heart? 
He is liberated from the thought of greed, hatred and delusion; 

(j) how is he well liberated by wisdom? 
 He understands: “For me greed, hatred and delusion are abandoned, cut off at the root, like a palm-tree stump, destroyed and incapable of growing again.” 



(6) ‘Ten qualities of the non-learner ^i[(asekha):]^f393
 The non-learner’s right view, right thought; right speech, right action, right livelihood; right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration; right knowledge ^i[(sammā̵̵-n͂āṇam) ,] right liberation ^i[(sammā̵̵vimutti).]‘
These are the 〔sets of〕 ten things which have been perfectly set forth by the Lord who knows and sees, the fully-enlightened Buddha. 
So we should all recite them together without disagreement, so that this holy life may be long-lasting and established for a long time to come, thus to be for the welfare and happiness of the multitude, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit, welfare and happiness of devas and humans.’ 
^n349 And when the Lord had stood up, he said to the Venerable Sariputta: 
‘Good, good, Sariputta! 
Well indeed have you proclaimed the way of chanting together for the monks!’
 These things were said by the Venerable Sariputta, and the Teacher confirmed them. 
The monks were delighted and rejoiced at the Venerable Sariputta’s words.

Once the Lord was staying at Campā beside the Gaggarā lotus-pond, with a large company of some five hundred monks.

‘Friends, monks!’ 
‘Friend!’ replied the monks. 
And the Venerable Sāriputta said:
‘In growing groups 
from one to ten I’ll teach Dhamma for the gaining of Nibbāna, 
That you may make an end of suffering, 
And be free from all the ties that bind.

(c)...his heart ^i[(cittam)] is bent on and inclined towards detachment ^i[(viveka),] slopes towards detachment and detachment is its object; rejoicing in renunciation ^i[(nekkhammdbhiratath),] his heart is totally unreceptive to all things pertaining to the corruptions...;

^n358 ‘Eight things greatly help, eight things are to be developed . . .
(1) ‘Which eight things greatly help? 
Eight causes, eight conditions conduce to wisdom in the fundamentals of the holy life, to gaining what has not been gained and to increasing, expanding and developing what has been gained. 
Here, 
(a) one lives close to the Teacher or to a fellow-monk with the standing of a teacher, being thus strongly established in moral shame and moral dread, in love and veneration... 

He who is so placed (b) from time to time goes to his teacher, asks and interrogates him: 
“How is that, Lord? 
What does this mean?” 
Thus his venerable teachers can reveal what is hidden and clarify obscurities, in this way helping him to solve his problems. 

(c) Then, having heard Dhamma from them, he achieves withdrawal ^i[(vūpakāsa),]^f413 of body and mind. 

(d) Further, a monk is moral, he lives restrained according to the restraint of the discipline, persisting in right behaviour, seeing danger in the slightest fault, and keeping to the rules of training. 

Also, (e) a monk, having learnt much, remembers and bears in mind what he has learnt, and those things that are beautiful in the beginning, in the middle and in the ending, which in spirit and letter proclaim the absolutely perfected and purified holy life, he remembers and reflects on, and penetrates them with vision. 

Again, (f) a monk, having stirred up energy, continues to dispel unwholesome states, striving strongly and firmly, and not casting off the yoke of the wholesome. 

Again, (g) a monk is mindful, with the highest mindfulness and discrimination, remembering and bearing in mind what has been done or said in the past. 

Also, (h) a monk continually contemplates the rise and fall of the five aggregates of grasping, thinking: 
“Such is material form, its arising and passing; 
such are feelings, 
such are perceptions, 
such are the mental formations, 
such is consciousness, its arising and passing.”

(c) for the withdrawn, not for those delighting in company; 
(d) for the energetic, not for the lazy; 
(e) for one of established mindfulness, not for one of lax mindfulness; 
(f) for one of concentrated mind, not for one who is not concentrated;
