^bk#dn2(Long Discourse2) ^ck#d14(^z1[Mahâpadāna Sutta: The Great Discourse on the Lineage] )^n1 THUS HAVE I HEARD.^f1 
Once the Lord was staying at Sāvatthi, in Anāthapindika’s park in the Jeta grove, in the Kareri hutment. 
And among a number of monks who had gathered together after their meal, after the alms-round, sitting in the Kareri pavilion, there arose a serious discussion on former lives, as they said: 
‘This is how it was in a former life’, or ‘That was how it was.’
^n2 And the Lord, with the purified divine-ear faculty surpassing the powers of humans, heard what they were talking about. 
Getting up from his seat, he went to the Kareri pavilion, sat down on the prepared seat, and said: 
‘Monks, what was your conversation as you sat together? What discussion did I interrupt?’ 
And they told him. 



^n3 ‘Well, monks, would you like to hear a proper discourse on past lives?’ 
‘Lord, it is time for that! Well-Farer, it is time for that! 
If the Lord were to give a proper discourse on past lives, the monks would listen and remember it!’ 
‘Well then, monks, listen, pay close attention, and I will speak.’
‘Yes, Lord’, the monks replied, 
and the Lord said:
^n4 ‘Monks, ninety-one aeons ago the Lord, the Arahant, the fully-enlightened Buddha Vipassī arose in the world. 
Thirty-one aeons ago the Lord Buddha Sikhī arose; in the same thirty-first aeon before this Lord Buddha Vessabhū arose. 
And in this present fortunate aeon^f2 
the Lords Buddhas Kakusandha, 
Konagamana 
and Kassapa arose in the world. 
And, monks, in this present fortunate aeon I too have now arisen in the world as a fully-enlightened Buddha.
^n5 ‘The Lord Buddha Vipassi was born of Khattiya race, and arose in a Khattiya family;
 the Lord Buddha Sikhi likewise;
 the Lord Buddha Vessabhū likewise; 
the Lord Buddha Kakusandha was born of Brahmin race, and arose in a Brahmin family; 
the Lord Buddha Konāgamana likewise; 
the Lord Buddha Kassapa likewise; 
and I, monks, who am now the Arahant and fully-enlightened Buddha, was born of Khattiya race, and arose in a Khattiya family.
^n6 ‘The Lord Buddha Vipassi was of the Kondañña clan; 
the Lord Buddah Sikhī likewise;
 the Lord Buddah Vessabhū likewise; 
the Lord Buddha Kakusandha was of the Kassapa clan; 
the Lord Buddha Konagāmana likewise;
 the Lord Buddha Kassapa likwise; I who am now the Arahant and fully . 
enlightened Buddha, am of the Gotama clan.
^n7 ‘In the time of the Lord Buddha Vipassi the life-span was eighty thousand years; 
in the time of the Lord Buddha Sikhi seventy thousand;
 in the time of the Lord Buddha Vessabhū sixty thousand;
 in the time of the Lord Buddha Kakusandhu forty thousand;
 in the time of the Lord Buddha Konāgamana thirty thousand;
 in the time of the Lord Buddha Kassapa it was twenty thousand years. 
In my time the lifespan is short, limited and quick to pass: it is seldom that anybody lives to be a hundred.
^n8 ‘The Lord Buddha Vipassi gained his full enlightenment at the foot of a trumpet-flower tree; 
the Lord Buddha Sikhi under a white-mango tree;
 the Lord Buddha Vessabhū under a ^i[sāl]-tree;
 the Lord Buddha Kakusandha under an acacia-tree;
 the Lord Buddha Konāgamana under a fig-tree; 
the Lord Buddha Kassapa under a banyan-tree; 
and I became fully enlightened at the foot of an ^i[assattha]-tree. ^f3
^n9 ‘The Lord Buddha Vipassi had the pair of noble disciples Khanda and Tissa;
 the Lord Buddha Sikhi had Abhibhū and Sambhava; 
the Lord Buddha Vessabhū had Sona and Uttara; 
the Lord Buddha Kakusandha had Vidhūra and Sañjīva;
 the Lord Buddha Konāgamana had Bhiyyosa and Uttara;
 the Lord Buddha Kassapa had Tissa and Bhāradvāja; 
I myself now have the pair of noble disciples Sāriputta and Moggallāna.
^n10 ‘The Lord Buddha Vipassi had three assemblies of disciples: one of six million eight hundred thousand, one of a hundred thousand, and one of eighty thousand monks, and of these three assemblies all were Arahants; 
the Lord Buddha Sikhi had three assemblies of disciples: one of a hundred thousand, one of eighty thousand, and one of seventy thousand monks — all Arahants;
 the Lord Buddha Vessabhū had three assemblies: one of eighty thousand, one of seventy thousand, and one of sixty thousand monks — all Arahants; 
the Lord Buddha Kakusandha had one assembly: forty thousand monks — all Arahants; 
the Lord Buddha Konagamana had one assembly: thirty thousand monks — all Arahants; 
the Lord Buddha Kassapa had one assembly: twenty thousand monks — all Arahants; 
I, monks, have one assembly of disciples, one thousand two hundred and fifty monks, and this one assembly consists only of Arahants.
^n11 ‘The Lord Buddha Vipassī’s personal attendant was the monk Asoka; 
the Lord Buddha Sikhī’s was Khemankara; 
the Lord Buddha Vessabhū’s was Upasannaka;
 the Lord Buddha Kakusandhu’s was Vuddhija; 
the Lord Buddha Konagamana’s was Sotthija; 
the Lord Buddha Kassapa’s was Sabbamitta; 
my chief personal attendant now is Ananda.
^n12 ‘The Lord Buddha Vipassī’s father was King Bandhuma, 
his mother was Queen Bandhumati, 
and King Bandhuma’s royal capital was Bandhumati. 
The Lord Buddha Sikhi’s father was King Aruna, 
his mother was Queen Pabhavati; 
King Aruna’s capital was Arunavatī. 
The Lord Buddha Vessabhū’s father was King Suppatita, 
his mother was Queen Yasavati; 
King Suppatīta’s capital was Anopama. 
The Lord Buddha Kakusandha’s father was the Brahmin Aggidatta, 
his mother was the Brahmin lady Visākhā. 
The king at that time was called Khema; 
his capital was Khemavati. 
The Lord Buddha Konagamana’s father was the Brahmin Yaññadatta, 
his mother was the Brahmin lady Uttara. 
The king at that time was Sobha; 
his capital was Sobhavati. 
The Lord Buddha Kassapa’s father was the Brahmin Brahmadatta, 
his mother was the Brahmin lady Dhanavati. 
The king at that time was Kiki; 
his capital was Vārānasī. 
And now, monks, my father was King Suddhodana, 
my mother was Queen Maya, 
and the royal capital was Kapilavatthu.’
Thus the Lord spoke, 
and the Well-Farer then rose from his seat and went to his lodging. 
^n13 Soon after the Lord had gone, another discussion arose among the monks:^f4 
‘It is marvellous, friends, it is wonderful, the Tathāgata’s great power and ability — 
the way he recalls past Buddhas who have gained Parinibbāna, having cut away the hindrances, cut off the road 〔of craving〕, put an end to the round of becoming, overcome all suffering. 
He recalls their birth, their name, their clan, their life-span, the disciples and assemblies connected with him: “Being born thus, these Blessed Lords were such-and-such, such were their names, their clans, their discipline, their Dhamma, their wisdom, their liberation.” 
Well now, friends, how did the Tathagata come by the penetrative knowledge through which he remembers all this ... ? 
Did some deva reveal this knowledge to him?’ 
This was the conversation of those monks which came to be interrupted.
^n14 Then the Lord, rising from the seclusion of the rest-period, went to the Kareri pavilion and sat down on the prepared seat. 
He said: 
‘Monks, what was your conversation as you sat together? What discussion did I interrupt?’ 
And the monks told him.









^n15 ‘The Tathāgata understands these things...
by his own penetration of the principles of Dhamma; 
and devas, too, have told him. 

Well, monks, do you wish to hear still more about past lives?’ 
‘Lord, it is time for that! Well-Farer, it is time for that! 
If the Lord were to give a proper discourse on past lives, the monks would listen and remember it.’ 
‘Well then, monks, listen, pay close attention, and I will speak.’ 
‘Yes, Lord’, the monks replied, 
and the Lord said:
^n16 ‘Monks, ninety-one aeons ago the Lord, the Arahant, the fully-enlightened Buddha Vipassi arose in the world. 
He was born of Khattiya race, and arose in a Khattiya family. 
He was of the Kondañña clan. 
The span of his life was eighty thousand years. 
He gained his full enlightenment at the foot of a trumpet-flower tree. 
He had the pair of noble disciples Khanda and Tissa as his chief followers. 
He had three assemblies of disciples: 
one of six million eight hundred thousand, one of a hundred thousand, and one of eighty thousand monks, 
all Arahants. 
His chief personal attendant was the monk Asoka. 
His father was King Bandhumā, 
his mother was Queen Bandhumatī. 
The king’s capital was Bandhumatī. 
^n17 ^f5‘And so, monks, the Bodhisatta Vipassi descended from the Tusita heaven, mindful and clearly aware, into his mother’s womb. 
This, monks, is the rule.^f6
^n18  ‘It is the rule, monks, that when a Bodhisatta descends from the Tusita heaven into his mother’s womb, 
there appears in this world with its devas, māras and Brahmās, its ascetics and Brahmins, princes and people an immeasurable, splendid light surpassing the glory of the most powerful devas. 
And whatever dark spaces lie beyond the world’s end, chaotic, blind and black, such that they are not even reached by the mighty rays of sun and moon, are yet illumined by this immeasurable splendid light surpassing the glory of the most powerful devas. 
And those beings that have been reborn there^f7 recognise each other by this light and know: “Other beings, too, have been born here!” 
And this ten-thousandfold world-system trembles and quakes and is convulsed. And this immeasurable light shines forth. 
That is the rule.
^n19 ‘It is the rule that when a Bodhisatta has entered his mother’s womb, four devas ^f8 come to protect him from the four quarters, saying: “Let no man, no non-human being, no thing whatever harm this Bodhisatta or this Bodhisatta’s mother!” 
That is the rule.
^n20 i.i8. ‘It is the rule that when a Bodhisatta has entered his mother’s womb, his mother becomes by nature virtuous, refraining from taking life, from taking what is not given, from sexual misconduct, from lying speech, or from strong drink and sloth-producing drugs. 
That is the rule.
^n21 ‘It is the rule that when a Bodhisatta has entered his mother’s womb, she has no sensual thoughts connected with a man, and she cannot be overcome by any man with lustful thoughts. 
That is the rule.
^n22 ‘It is the rule that when a Bodhisatta has entered his mother’s womb, she enjoys the fivefold pleasures of the senses and takes delight, being endowed and possessed of them. 
That is the rule.
^n23 ‘It is the rule that when a Bodhisatta has entered his mother’s womb, she has no sickness of any kind, she is at ease and without fatigue of body, and she can see the Bodhisatta inside her womb, complete with all his members and faculties. 
Monks, it is as if a gem, a beryl, pure, excellent, well cut into eight facets, clear, bright, flawless and perfect in every respect, were strung on a blue, yellow, red, white or orange cord. 
And a man with good eyesight, taking it in his hand, would describe it as such. 
Thus does the Bodhisatta’s mother, with no sickness, see him, complete with all his members and faculties. 
That is the rule.
^n24 ‘It is the rule that the Bodhisatta’s mother dies seven days after his birth and is reborn in the Tusita heaven. 
That is the rule.
^n25 ‘It is the rule that whereas other women carry the child in their womb for nine or ten months before giving birth, it is not so with the Bodhisatta’s mother, who carries him for exactly ten months before giving birth. 
That is the rule.
^n26 ‘It is the rule that whereas other women give birth sitting or lying down, it is not so with the Bodhisatta’s mother, who gives birth standing up. 
That is the rule.
^n27 ‘It is the rule that when the Bodhisatta issues from his mother’s womb, devas welcome him first, and then humans. 
That is the rule.
^n28 ‘It is the rule that when the Bodhisatta issues from his mother’s womb, he does not touch the earth. Four devas^f9 receive him and place him before his mother, saying: “Rejoice, Your Majesty, a mighty son has been born to you!” 
That is the rule.
^n29 ‘It is the rule that when the Bodhisatta issues from his mother’s womb he issues forth stainless, not defiled by water, mucus, blood or any impurity, pure and spotless. 
Just as when a jewel is laid on muslin from Kāsī,^f10 the jewel does not stain the muslin, or the muslin the jewel. 
Why not? 
Because of the purity of both. 
In the same way the Bodhisatta issues forth stainless... 
That is the rule.
^n30 ‘It is the rule that when the Bodhisatta issues forth from his mother’s womb, two streams of water appear from the sky, one cold, the other warm, with which they ritually wash the Bodhisatta and his mother. 
That is the rule.
^n31 ‘It is the rule that as soon as he is born the Bodhisatta takes a firm stance on both feet facing north, then takes seven strides and, under a white sunshade,^f11 he scans the four quarters and then declares with a bull-like voice: “I am chief in the world, supreme in the world, eldest in the world. This is my last birth, there will be no more re-becoming.”^f12 
That is the rule.
^n32 ‘It is the rule that when the Bodhisatta issues from his mother’s womb there appears in this world... 
an immeasurable, splendid light... 
^i[(as verse 17)]. 

This is the rule.^f13
^n33 ‘Monks, when Prince Vipassi was born, they showed him to King Bandhumā and said: 
“Your Majesty, a son has been born to you. Deign, Sire, to look at him.” 
The king looked at the prince and then said to the Brahmins skilled in signs: 
“You gentlemen are skilled in signs, examine the prince.” 
The Brahmins examined the prince, and said to King Bandhumā: 
“Sire, rejoice, for a mighty son has been born to you. It is a gain for you, Sire, it is a great profit for you, Sire, that such a son has been born into your family. 
Sire, this prince is endowed with the thirty-two marks of a Great Man. To such, only two courses are open. 
If he lives the household life he will become a ruler, a wheel-turning righteous monarch of the law, conqueror of the four quarters, who has established the security of his realm and is possessed of the seven treasures. 
These are: 
the Wheel Treasure, the Elephant Treasure, the Horse Treasure, the Jewel Treasure, the Woman Treasure, the Householder Treasure, and, as seventh, the Counsellor Treasure. 
He has more than a thousand sons who are heroes, of heroic stature, conquerors of the hostile army. 
He dwells having conquered this sea-girt land without stick or sword, by the law. 
But if he goes forth from the household life into homelessness, then he will become an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, one who draws back the veil from the world.”
^n34 “‘And what, Sire, are these thirty-two marks...?^f14






^n35  (1) He has feet with level tread. 
(2) On the soles of his feet are wheels with a thousand spokes. 
(3) He has projecting heels. 
(4) He has long fingers and toes. 
(5) He has soft and tender hands and feet. 
(6) His hands and feet are net-like.
(7) He has high-raised ankles. 
(8) His legs are like an antelope’s. 
(9) Standing and without bending, he can touch and rub his knees with either hand. 
(10) His male organs are enclosed in a sheath. 
(11) His complexion is bright, the colour of gold. 
(12) His skin is delicate and so smooth that no dust adheres to it. 
(13) His body-hairs are separate, one to each pore. 
(14) They grow upwards, bluish-black like collyrium, growing in rings to the right. 
(15) His body is divinely straight. 
(16) He has the seven convex surfaces. 
(17) The front part of his body is like a lion’s. 
(18) There is no hollow between his shoulders. 
(19) He is proportioned like a banyan-tree: his height is as the span of his arms. 
(20) His bust is evenly rounded. 
(21) He has a perfect sense of taste. 
(22) He has jaws like a lion’s. 
(23) He has forty teeth. 
(24) His teeth are even. 
(25) There are no spaces between his teeth. 
(26) His canine teeth are very bright. 
(27) His tongue is very long. 
(28) He has a Brahmā-like voice, like that of the karavīka-bird. 
(29) His eyes are deep blue. 
(30) He has eyelashes like a cow’s. 
(31) The hair between his eyebrows is white, and soft like cotton-down. 
(32) His head is like a royal turban.”
^n36 “‘Sire, this prince is endowed with the thirty-two marks of a Great Man. To such, only two courses are open. 
If he lives the household life he will become a ruler, a wheel-turning righteous monarch of the law...




But if he goes forth from the household life into homelessness, then he will become an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, one who draws back the veil from the world.”
^n37 ‘Then King Bandhuma, having clothed those Brahmins in fresh clothes, satisfied all their wishes.
‘And King Bandhuma appointed nurses for Prince Vipassi. 
Some suckled him, some bathed him, some carried him, some dandled him. 
A white umbrella was held over him night and day, 
that he might not be harmed by cold or heat or grass or dust. 
And Prince Vipassi was much beloved of the people. 
Just as everybody loves a blue, yellow or white lotus,
 so they all loved Prince Vipassi. 
Thus he was borne from lap to lap.
^n38 ‘And Prince Vipassi had a sweet voice, a beautiful voice, charming and delightful. 
Just as in the Himālaya mountains the ^i[karavīka-bird] has a voice sweeter, more beautiful, charming and delightful than all other birds, 
so too was Prince Vipassī’s voice the finest of all.
^n39 ‘And owing to the results of past kamma, the divine eye was present to Prince Vipassi, with which he could see for a league day and night alike. 
^n40 ‘And Prince Vipassi was unblinkingly watchful, like the Thirty-Three Gods. 
And because it was said that he was unblinkingly watchful, the prince came to be called “Vipas-Sī”. ^f15
^n41  When King Bandhumā was trying a case, he took Prince Vipassi on his knee and instructed him in the case. 
Then, putting him down from his knee, his father would carefully explain the issues to him. 
And for this reason he was all the more called Vipassi.
^n42 ‘Then King Bandhumā caused three palaces to be built for Prince Vipassi, one for the rainy season, one for the cold season, and one for the hot season,
 to cater for all the fivefold sense-pleasures. 
There Prince Vipassi stayed in the rainy-season palace for the four months of the rainy season, with no male attendants, surrounded by female musicians, and he never left that palace.’
 ^i[End of first recitation-section (the birth-section)〕] 
^n43 ‘Then, monks, after many years, many hundreds and thousands of years had passed, ^f16 Prince Vipassi said to his charioteer: 
“Harness some fine carriages, charioteer! We will go to the pleasure-park to inspect it.” 
The charioteer did so, then reported to the prince: 
“Your Royal Highness, the fine carriages are harnessed, 
it is time to do as you wish.” 
And Prince Vipassi mounted a carriage and drove in procession to the pleasure-park.
^n44 ‘And as he was being driven to the pleasure-park, Prince Vipassi saw an aged man, bent like a roof-beam, broken, leaning on a stick, tottering, sick, his youth all vanished. 
At the sight he said to the charioteer: 
“Charioteer, what is the matter with this man?
 His hair is not like other men’s, his body is not like other men’s.” 
“‘Prince, that is what is called an old man.” 
“But why is he called an old man?” 
“‘He is called old, Prince, because he has not long to live.” 
“‘But am I liable to become old, and not exempt from old age?” 
“Both you and I, Prince, are liable to become old, and are not exempt from old age.”
“‘Well then, charioteer, that will do for today with the pleasure-park. Return now to the palace.” 
“Very good, Prince”, said the charioteer, and brought Prince Vipassi back to the palace.^f17
 Arrived there, Prince Vipassi was overcome with grief and dejection, crying: 
“Shame on this thing birth, since to him who is born old age must manifest itself!”
^n45 ‘Then King Bandhumā sent for the charioteer and said: 
“Well, did not the prince enjoy himself at the pleasure-park? Wasn’t he happy there?” 
“Your Majesty, the prince did not enjoy himself, he was not happy there.” 
“What did he see on the way there?” 
So the charioteer told the King all that had happened.











^n46 ‘Then King Bandhumā thought: 
“Prince Vipassi must not renounce the throne, he must not go forth from the household life into homelessness - the words of the Brahmins learned in signs must not come true!” 
So the King provided for Prince Vipassi to have even more enjoyment of the fivefold sense-pleasures, 
in order that he should rule the kingdom and not go forth from the household life into homelessness... 
Thus the prince continued to live indulging in, and addicted to the fivefold sense-pleasures.
^i[‘After many hundreds of thousands of years Prince Vipassī ordered his charioteer to drive to the pleasure-park (as verse 2.1)].  
^n47 ‘And as he was being driven to the pleasure-park, Prince Vipassi saw a sick man, suffering, very ill, fallen in his own urine and excrement, and some people were picking him up, and others putting him to bed. 
At the sight he said to the charioteer: 
“What is the matter with this man? 
His eyes are not like other men’s, his head ^f18 is not like other men’s.” 
“‘Prince, that is what is called a sick man.” 
“But why is he called a sick man?”
“‘Prince, he is so called because he can hardly recover from his illness.”
“‘But am I liable to become sick, and not exempt from sickness ?” 
“Both you and I, Prince, are liable to become sick, and not exempt from sickness.” 
“‘Well then, charioteer, return now to the palace.” 

Arrived there, Prince Vipassi was overcome with grief and dejection, crying: 
“Shame on this thing birth, since he who is born must experience sickness!”
^n48 ‘Then King Bandhumā sent for the charioteer, who told him what had happened. 















^n49 ‘The king provided Prince Vipassi with even more sense-pleasures, 
in order that he should rule the kingdom and not go forth from the household life into homelessness...



^i[‘After many hundreds of thousands of years Prince Vipassī] ordered his charioteer to drive to the pleasure-park.
^n50 ‘And as he was being driven to the pleasure-park, Prince Vipassi saw a large crowd collecting, clad in many colours, and carrying a bier. 
At the sight he said to the charioteer: 
“Why are those people doing that?” 
“Prince, that is what they call a dead man.” 
“Drive me over to where the dead man is.” 
“Very good, Prince, said the charioteer, and did so. 
And Prince Vipassi gazed at the corpse of the dead man. Then he said to the charioteer: 
”Why is he called a dead man?”
“‘Prince, he is called a dead man because now his parents and other relatives will not see him again, nor he them.”
“‘But am I subject to dying, not exempt from dying?” 


“Both you and I, Prince, are subject to dying, not exempt from it.”


“‘Well then, charioteer, that will do for today with the pleasure-park. 
Return now to the palace... 
Arrived there, Prince Vipassi was overcome with grief and dejection, crying: 
”Shame on this thing birth, since to him who is born death must manifest itself!”
^n51 ‘Then King Bandhumā sent for the charioteer, who told him what had happened. 






















^n52 ‘The king provided Prince Vipassi with even more sense-pleasures... 




^i[‘After many hundreds of thousands of years Prince Vipassī ordered his charioteer to drive to the pleasure-park.]





^n53 ‘And as he was being driven to the pleasure-park, Prince Vipassi saw a shaven-headed man, one who had gone forth,^f19 wearing a yellow robe. 
And he said to the charioteer: 
“What is the matter with that man? His head is not like other men’s, 
and his clothes are not like other men’s.”
“‘Prince, he is called one who has gone forth.” 
“Why is he called one who has gone forth?”
“‘Prince, by one who has gone forth we mean one who truly follows Dhammas, ^f20 who truly lives in serenity, does good actions, performs meritorious deeds, is harmless and truly has compassion for living beings.”
“‘Charioteer, he is well called one who has gone forth... 
Drive the carriages over to where he is.” 
“Very good, Prince”, said the charioteer, and did so. 
And Prince Vipassi questioned the man who had gone forth.




“‘Prince, as one who has gone forth I truly follow Dhamma, ...and have compassion for living beings.” 
“You are well called one who has gone forth...”
^n54 ‘Then Prince Vipassi said to the charioteer: 
“You take the carriage and drive back to the palace. 
But I shall stay here and shave off my hair and beard, put on yellow robes, and go forth from the household life into homelessness.” 
“Very good, Prince”, said the charioteer, and returned to the palace. 
And Prince Vipassi, shaving off his hair and beard and putting on yellow robes, went forth from the household life into homelessness.
^n55 ‘And a great crowd from the royal capital city, Ban dhumati, eighty-four thousand people,^f21 heard 
that Prince Vipassi had gone forth into homelessness. 
And they thought: 
“This is certainly no common teaching and discipline, no common going-forth, for which Prince Vipassi has shaved off hair and beard, donned yellow robes and gone forth into homelessness. 
If the Prince has done so, why should not we?” 
And so, monks, a great crowd of eighty-four thousand, having shaved off their hair and beards and donned yellow robes, followed the Bodhisatta Vipassī^f22 into homelessness. 
And with this following the Bodhisatta went on his rounds through villages, towns and royal cities.
^n56 ‘Then the Bodhisatta Vipassi, having retired to a secluded spot, had this thought: 
“It is not proper for me to live with a crowd like this. I must live alone, withdrawn from this crowd.” 
So after a while he left the crowd and dwelt alone. The eighty-four thousand went one way, the Bodhisatta another.
^n57 ‘Then, when the Bodhisatta had entered his dwelling alone, in a secluded spot, he thought: 
“This world, alas, is in a sorry state: there is birth and decay,^f23 there is death and falling into other states and being reborn. And no one knows any way of escape from this suffering, this ageing and death. 
When will deliverance be found from this suffering, this ageing and death?”
‘And then, monks, the Bodhisatta thought: 
“With what being present, does ageing-and-death occur? What conditions ageing-and-death?” 
And then, monks, as a result of the wisdom born of profound consideration^f24 the realisation dawned on him: 
“Birth being present, ageing-and-death occurs, birth conditions ageing-and-death.”^f25
‘Then he thought: 
“What conditions birth?” 
And the realisation dawned on him: 
“Becoming^f26 conditions birth” ... 

“What conditions becoming?” ... 

“Clinging conditions becoming”... 



“Craving conditions clinging”... 



“Feeling conditions craving” ... 



“Contact^f27 conditions feeling”... 



“The six sense-bases condition contact”... 



“Mind-and-body conditions the six sense-bases”... 



“Consciousness conditions mind-and-body.” 
And then the Bodhisatta Vipassi thought: 
“With what being present, does consciousness occur. What conditions consciousness?” 
And then, as a result of the wisdom born of profound consideration,
 the realisation dawned on him: “Mind-and-body conditions consciousness.”
^n58 ‘Then, monks, the Bodhisatta Vipassi thought: 
“This consciousness turns back at mind-and-body, it does not go any further.^f28 
To this extent there is birth and decay, there is death and falling into other states and being reborn, namely: 
Mind-and-body conditions consciousness and consciousness conditions mind-and-body, mind-and-body conditions the six sense-bases, the six sense-bases-condition contact, contact conditions feeling, feeling conditions craving, craving conditions clinging, clinging conditions becoming, becoming conditions birth, birth conditions ageing and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and distress. 
And thus this whole mass of suffering takes its origin.” 
^n59  And at the thought: “Origin, origin”, there arose in the Bodhisatta Vipassi, with insight into things never realised before, knowledge, wisdom, awareness, and light.
^n60 ‘Then he thought: 
“What now being absent, does ageing-and-death not occur? With the cessation of what comes the cessation of ageing-and-death?” 
And then, as a result of the wisdom born of profound consideration, the realisation dawned on him: 
“Birth being absent, ageing-and-death does not occur. 



With the cessation of birth comes the cessation of ageing-and-death”... 


“With the cessation of what comes the cessation of birth?”... 


“With the cessation of becoming comes the cessation of birth”... 


“With the cessation of clinging comes the cessation of becoming”... 


“With the cessation of craving comes the cessation of clinging”... 


“With the cessation of feeling comes the cessation of craving”... 


“With the cessation of contact comes the cessation of feeling”... 


“With the cessation of the six sense-bases comes the cessation of contact”... 


“With the cessation of mind-and-body comes the cessation of the six sense-bases”... 


“With the cessation of consciousness comes the cessation of mind-and-body”... 


“With the cessation of mind-and-body comes the cessation of consciousness.”


^n61 ‘Then the Bodhisatta Vipassi thought: 
“I have found the insight (^i[vipassanā]) way^f29 to enlightenment, namely:
 “‘By the cessation of mind-and-body consciousness ceases, by the cessation of consciousness, mind-and-body ceases; by the cessation of mind-and-body the six sense-bases cease; by the cessation of the six sense-bases contact ceases; by the cessation of contact feeling ceases; by the cessation of feeling craving ceases; by the cessation of craving clinging ceases; by the cessation of clinging becoming ceases; by the cessation of becoming birth ceases; by the cessation of birth ageing and death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and distress cease. 
And thus this whole mass of suffering ceases.” 
^n62  And at the thought: “Cessation, cessation”, there arose in the Bodhisatta Vipassi, with insight into things never realised before, knowledge, vision, awareness, and light.
^n63 ‘Then, monks, at another time the Bodhisatta Vipassi dwelt contemplating the rise and fall of the five aggregates of clinging: 
“Such is the body, such its arising, such its passing away; 
such is feeling...; 
such is perception...; 
such are the mental formations...; 
such is consciousness, such its arising, such its passing away.” 
And as he remained contemplating the rise and fall of the five aggregates of dinging, before long his mind was freed from the corruptions without remainder .’^f30
 ^i[〔End of second recitation-section〕] 
^n64 ‘Then, monks, the Blessed Lord, the Arahant, the fully-enlightened Buddha Vipassi thought: 
“Suppose now I were to teach Dhamma?” 
And then he thought: 
“I have attained to this Dhamma which is profound, hard to see, hard to grasp, peaceful, excellent, beyond reasoning,^f31 subtle, to be apprehended by the wise. 
But this generation delights in clinging,^f32 rejoices in it and revels in it. 
But for those who so delight, rejoice and revel in clinging this matter is hard to see, namely the conditioned nature of things, ^f33 or dependent origination. ^f34 
Equally hard to see would be the calming of all the mental formations,^f35 the abandonment of all the substrates of rebirth,^f36 the waning of craving, dispassion, cessation and Nibbāna. 
And if I were to teach Dhamma to others and they did not understand me, that would be a weariness and a trouble to me.”
^n65 ‘And to the Lord Buddha Vipassi there occurred spontaneously this verse, never previously heard:
“This that I’ve attained, 
why should I proclaim? 
Those full of lust and hate 
can never grasp it. 
Leading upstream this 
Dhamma, subtle, deep, 
Hard to see, 
no passion-blinded folk can see it.”
‘As the Lord Buddha Vipassi pondered thus, his mind was inclined to inaction rather than to teaching the Dhamma. 
^n66 And, monks, the Lord Buddha Vipassī’s reasoning became mentally known to a certain Great Brahma.^f37 And he thought: 
“Alas, the world is perishing, it will be destroyed because the mind of Vipassi, the Blessed Lord, the Arahant, the fully-enlightened Buddha is inclined to inaction rather than to teaching the Dhamma!”
‘So this Great Brahmā, as swiftly as a strong man might stretch his flexed arm, or flex it again, disappeared from the Brahmā world and reappeared before the Lord Buddha Vipassi. 
Arranging his upper robe over one shoulder and kneeling on his right knee, he saluted the Lord Buddha Vipassi with joined hands and said: 
“Lord, may the Blessed Lord teach Dhamma, may the Well-Farer teach Dhamma! 
There are beings with little dust on their eyes who are perishing through not hearing Dhamma: 
they will become knowers of Dhamma!״^f38 
^n67 ^i[. ‘Then the Lord Buddha Vipassī explained (as verses 1 — 2 above) why he inclined to inaction rather than to teaching the Dhamma.]


















^n68 ‘And the Great Brahmā appealed a second and a third time to the Lord Buddha Vipassi to teach...


^n69 Then the Lord Buddha Vipassi, recognising Brahmā׳s appeal and moved by compassion for beings, surveyed the world with his Buddha-eye. ^f39
 And he saw beings with little dust on their eyes and with much dust, with faculties sharp and dull, of good and bad disposition, easy and hard to teach, and few of them living in fear of transgression and of the next world. 
And just as in a pool of blue, red or white lotuses some are born in the water, grow in the water, and, not leaving the water, thrive in the water; some are born in the water and reach the surface; while some are born in the water and, having reached the surface, grow out of the water and are not polluted by it, 
in the same way, monks, the Lord Buddha Vipassi, surveying the world with his Buddha-eye, saw some beings with little dust on their eyes...
^n70 ‘Then, knowing his thought, the Great Brahmā addressed the Lord Buddha Vipassi in these verses:
“As on a mountain-peak 
a watcher sees the folk below, 
So, Man of Wisdom,^f40 seeing all, 
look down from Dhamma’s heights! 
Free from woe, look on those 
who are sunk in grief, oppressed with birth and age. 
Arise, hero, victor in battle, 
leader of the caravan, traverse the world! 
Teach, O Lord, the Dhamma, 
and they will understand.”
^n71  And the Lord Buddha Vipassi replied to the Great Brahma in verse:
“Open to them are the doors of the Deathless! 
Let those that hear now put forth faith.^f41
For fear of trouble I did not preach 
at first The excellent Dhamma for men, Brahma!”
Then that Great Brahma, thinking: “I have been the cause of the Lord Buddha Vipassī׳s preaching Dhamma”, made obeisance to the Lord Buddha, and, passing by to his right, vanished there and then.
^n72 ‘Then the Lord Buddha Vipassi thought: 
“To whom should I first teach this Dhamma? 
Who would understand it quickly?” 
Then he thought: 
“There are Khanda the King’s son^f42 and Tissa the chaplain׳s^f43 son, living in the capital city of Bandhumati. They are wise, learned, experienced, and for a long time have had little dust on their eyes. 
If now I teach Dhamma first to Khanda and Tissa, they will understand it quickly.” 
^n73 And so the Lord Buddha Vipassi, as swiftly as a strong man might stretch out his flexed arm, or flex it again, vanished there and then from the root of that tree of enlightenment, and reappeared in the royal capital of Bandhumati, in the deer-park of Khema.
‘And the Lord Buddha Vipassi said to the park-keeper: 
“Keeper, go to Bandhumati and say to Prince Khanda and the chaplain’s son Tissa:
 ‘My lords, Vipassi the Blessed Lord, the Arahant, the fully-enlightened Buddha, has come to Bandhumati and is staying in the deer-park of Khema. He wishes to see you.׳ ״ 
“‘Very good, Lord”, said the park-keeper, 
and went and delivered the message.
^n74 ‘Then Khanda and Tissa, having harnessed some fine carriages, drove out of Bandhumati making for the deer-park of Khema. 
They took the carriages as far as they would go, then alighted and continued on foot till they came to the Lord Buddha Vipassi. When they reached him, they made obeisance to him and sat down to one side.
^n75 ‘And the Lord Buddha Vipassi delivered to them 
a graduated discourse on generosity, on morality, and on heaven, ^f44 showing the danger, degradation and corruption of sense-desires, and the profit of renunciation. 
And when the Lord Buddha Vipassi knew that the minds of Khanda and Tissa were ready, pliable, free from the hindrances, joyful and calm, then he preached the Buddhas’ special sermon in brief: 
on suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path. 
And just as a clean cloth from which all stains have been removed receives the dye perfectly, 
so in Prince Khanda and Tissa the chaplain׳s son, as they sat there, there arose the pure and spotless Dhamma-Eye, and they knew: 
“Whatever things have an origin must come to cessation.”
^n76 ‘And they, having seen, attained, experienced and penetrated the Dhamma, having passed beyond doubt, having gained perfect confidence in the Teacher’s doctrine without relying on others, said: 
“Excellent, Lord, excellent! 
It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there. Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways. 
We go for refuge to the Lord, and to the Dhamma. 
May we receive the going-forth at the Lord’s hands, may we receive ordination!”
^n77 ‘And so Prince Khanda and Tissa the chaplain’s son received the going-forth at the hands of the Lord Buddha Vipassi, and they received ordination. 
Then the Lord Buddha Vipassi instructed them with a discourse on Dhamma, inspired them, fired them and delighted them, 
showing the danger, degradation and corruption of conditioned things^f45 and the profit of Nibbāna.^f46
 And through their being inspired, fired and delighted with this discourse, it was not long before their minds were freed from the corruptions without remainder.
^n78 ׳And a great crowd of eighty-four thousand people from Bandhumati heard 
that the Lord Buddha Vipassi was staying in the deer-park of Khema, 
and that Khanda and Tissa had shaved off their hair and beards, donned yellow robes, and gone forth from the household life into homelessness. 
And they thought: 
“This is certainly no common teaching and discipline...for which Prince Khanda and Tissa the chaplain’s son have gone forth into homelessness. 
If they can do this in the presence of the Lord Buddha Vipassi, why should not we?” 
And so this great crowd of eighty-four thousand left Bandhumati for the deer-park of Khema where the Lord Buddha Vipassi was. When they came to him they made obeisance to him and sat down to one side.
^n79 ‘And the Lord Buddha Vipassi delivered to them 
a graduated discourse on generosity, on morality, and on heaven, showing the danger, degradation and corruption of sense-desires, and the profit of renunciation. 


And just as a clean cloth...
receives the dye perfectly, so in those eighty-four thousand, as they sat there, there arose the pure and spotless Dhamma-eye, and they knew: 
“Whatever things have an origin must come to cessation.”
^n80 (^i[as verse 12)] 




^n81 ‘And those eighty-four thousand received the going-forth at the hands of the Lord Buddha Vipassi, and they received ordination. 
And the Lord Buddha Vipassi instructed them with a discourse on Dhamma... 

(^i[as verse 13)] and it was not long before their minds were freed from the corruptions without remainder.
^n82 ‘Then the first eighty-four thousand who had gone forth heard: 
“The Lord Buddha Vipassi has come to Bandhumatī and is staying in the Khema deer-park, teaching Dhamma.”

^n83 






^n84 




^n85 ‘And all happened as before... 
And it was not long before their minds were freed from the corruptions without remainder.


^n86 ‘And at that time, in the royal capital of Bandhumati, there was a vast gathering of six million, eight hundred thousand ^f47 monks. 
And when the Lord Buddha Vipassi had withdrawn into seclusion, he thought: 
“There is now this great gathering of monks here in the capital. Suppose I were to give them permission: 
‘Wander abroad, monks, for the good of the many, for the happiness of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the welfare and happiness of devas and humans. 
Do not go two together, monks, 
but teach the Dhamma that is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, and lovely in its ending, both in the letter and in the spirit, and display the holy life fully complete and perfect. 
There are beings with little dust on their eyes who are perishing through not hearing Dhamma: 
they will become knowers of Dhamma. 
But at the end of six years precisely you are to come together to the royal capital of Bandhumati to recite the disciplinary code.״ ׳ 
^n87 ‘Then a certain Great Brahmā, having divined the Lord Buddha Vipassī׳s thought, as swiftly as a strong man might stretch his flexed arm, or flex it again, vanished from the Brahmā world and appeared before the Lord Buddha Vipassi. 
Arranging his robe over one shoulder and saluting the Lord with joined palms, he said: 
“Just so, O Lord, just so, O Well-Farer! 
Let the Lord give permission to this great gathering to wander abroad for the good of the many,... 
out of compassion for the world...
There are beings with little dust on their eyes, who are perishing through not hearing Dhamma: 
they will become knowers of Dhamma. 
And we too will do the same as the monks: 
at the end of six years we will come together to the royal capital of Bandhumati to recite the disciplinary code.”
׳Having spoken thus, 
that Brahmā made obeisance to the Lord Buddha and, passing by to his right, vanished there and then.
^n88 ‘So the Lord Buddha Vipassi, emerging from the seclusion of his rest-period, told the monks what had occurred occurred. 




















‘ “I allow you, monks, to wander abroad for the good of the many, for the welfare and happiness of devas and humans. 
Do not go two together, monks, 
but teach the Dhamma that is lovely in its beginning, lovely in its middle, and lovely in its ending, both in the letter and in the spirit, and display the holy life fully complete and perfect. 
There are beings with little dust on their eyes who are perishing through not hearing Dhamma: 
they will become knowers of Dhamma. 
But at the end of six years precisely you are to come together to the royal capital of Bandhumati to recite the disciplinary code.” 
And the majority of those monks left that very day to wander about the country.
^n89 ‘And at that time there were eighty-four thousand religious residences in Jambudīpa.^f48
 And at the end of one year the devas would proclaim: 
“Gentlemen, one year has passed, 
five remain. 
At the end of five years you are to return to Bandhumati to recite the disciplinary code”
, and similarly at the end of two, 
three, 
four, 
five years. 



And when six years had passed, the devas announced: 
“Gentlemen, six years have passed, 
it is now time to go to the royal capital of Bandhumatī to recite the disciplinary code!” 
And those monks, some by their own psychic powers and some by that of the devas, all in one day came to Bandhumati to recite the disciplinary code.
^n90 ‘And then the Lord Buddha Vipassi gave to the assembled monks the following precepts:
“Patient forbearance is the highest sacrifice, 
Supreme is Nibbāna, so say the Buddhas. 
He’s not ‘one gone forth’ who hurts others, 
No ascetic he who harms another.^f49
  Not to do any evil, 
but cultivate the good, 
To purify one’s mind, 
this the Buddhas teach.^f50
  Not insulting, not harming, 
restraint according to rule, 
Moderation in food, 
seclusion of dwelling, 
Devotion to high thinking, 
this the Buddhas teach.״^f51 
^n91 ‘Once, monks, I was staying at Ukkatthā^f52 in the Subhaga grove at the foot of a great ^i[sāl-tree.]
 And as I dwelt there in seclusion it occurred to me: 
“There is no abode of beings easily accessible that has not been visited by me for so long as that of the devas of the Pure Abodes.^f53
 Suppose I were to visit them now?” 
And then, as swiftly as a strong man might stretch his flexed arm, or flex it again, I vanished from Ukkatṭhā and appeared among the Aviha devas. 
And many thousands of them came to me, saluted me and stood to one side. Then they said: 
״Sir,^f54 it is ninety-one aeons since the Lord Buddha Vipassi appeared in the world.״ 
׳The Lord Buddha Vipassi was born of Khattiya race, and arose in a Khattiya family; 
he was of the Koṇḍañña clan; 
in his time the life-span was eighty thousand years; 
he gained his full enlightenment under a trumpet-flower tree; 
he had the pair of noble disciples Khanda and Tissa; 
he had three assemblies of disciples, one of six million eight hundred thousand, one of a hundred thousand, and one of eighty thousand monks, all of whom were Arahants; 
his chief personal attendant was the monk Asoka, 
his father was King Bandhuma, 
his mother was Queen Bandhumatī, 
and his father’s royal capital was Bandhumatī. 
The Lord Buddha Vipassī׳s renunciation was like this, his going-forth like this, his striving like this, his full enlightenment like this; his turning of the wheel like this.
“‘And we, sir, who lived the holy life under the Lord Buddha Vipassi, having freed ourselves from sense-desires, have arisen here.״^f55 
‘In the same way many thousands of devas came... 
(^i[referring similarly to Sikhī and other Buddhas as verse 1.12).] They said: 
“Sir, in this fortunate aeon now the Lord Buddha has arisen in the world. 
He was born of Khattiya race...; 
he is of the Gotama clan; 
in his time the life-span is short, limited and quick to pass: it is seldom that anybody lives to be a hundred. 
He gained his full enlightenment under an ^i[assattha]-tree; 
he has a pair of noble disciples Sariputta and Moggallāna; 
he has one assembly of disciples, one thousand two hundred and fifty monks who are all Arahants; 
his chief personal attendant is Ananda; 
his father is King Suddhodana, 
his mother was Queen Maya, 
and his royal capital is Kapilavatthu. 
Such was the Lord’s renunciation, such his going-forth, such his striving, such his full enlightenment, such his turning of the wheel. 
And we, sir, who have lived the holy life under the Lord, having freed ourselves from sense-desires, have arisen here.”
^n92 


























^n93 ‘Then I went with the Aviha devas to see the Atappa devas, and with these to see the Sudassa devas, and with these to see the Sudassi devas, and with all of these to see the Akanittha devas. 
And there many thousands of devas came, saluted me and stood to one side, saying: 
“Sir, it is ninety-one aeons since the Lord Buddha Vipassi appeared in the world...” 
(^i[as verses 29 — 30).]











^n94 ‘And so it is, monks, that by his penetration of the fundamentals of Dhamma^f56 the Tathagata remembers the past Buddhas who have attained final Nibbāna, cutting through multiplicity,^f57 blazing a trail, have exhausted the round,^f58 have passed by all suffering; he recalls their births, their names, their clan, their life-span, their twin-disciples, their assemblies of disciples: 
“These Blessed Lords were born thus, were called thus, thus was their clan, thus was their morality, their Dhamma, their wisdom, their dwelling, thus was their liberation.’ ”^f59 
 

Thus the Lord spoke, 
and the monks, delighted, rejoiced at his words.

^ck#d15(^z1[Mahānidāna Sutta: The Great Discourse on Origination] )^n95 THUS HAVE I HEARD.^f60 
Once the Lord was staying among the Kurus. There is a market town there called Kammāsadhamma. ^f61 
And the Venerable Ananda came to the Lord, saluted him, sat down to one side, and said: 
‘It is wonderful, Lord, it is marvellous 
how profound this dependent origination is, and how profound it appears! And yet it appears to me as clear as clear!’
‘Do not say that, Ananda, do not say that! 
This dependent origination is profound and appears profound. 
It is through not understanding, not penetrating this doctrine that this generation has become like a tangled ball of string, covered as with a blight,^f62 tangled like coarse grass, unable to pass beyond states of woe, the ill destiny, ruin and the round of birth-and-death.^f63
^n96 ‘If, Ananda, you are asked: “Has ageing-and-death a condition for its existence?״^f64 you should answer: “Yes.” 
If asked: “What conditions ageing-and-death?” you should answer: “Ageing-and-death is conditioned by birth.”... 
“What conditions birth?”... 
“Becoming conditions birth.”... 

“Clinging conditions becoming.”... 

“Craving conditions clinging.”... 
“Feeling conditions craving.”...
“Contact conditions feeling.” ... 

“Mind-and-body conditions contact.”^f65... 

”Consciousness conditions mind-and-body.”...

If asked: “Has consciousness a condition for its existence?” you should answer: “Yes.” 
If asked: “What conditions consciousness?” you should answer: “Mind-and-body conditions consciousness.”^f66

^n97 ‘Thus, Ānanda, mind-and-body conditions consciousness and consciousness conditions mind-and-body, mind-and-body conditions contact, contact conditions feeling, feeling conditions craving, craving conditions clinging, clinging conditions becoming, becoming conditions birth, birth conditions ageing-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief and distress.^f67 
Thus this whole mass of suffering comes into existence.
^n98 ‘I have said: “Birth conditions ageing-and-death”, and this is the way that should be understood. 
If, Ananda, there were no birth at all, anywhere, of anybody or anything: 
of devas to the deva-state, of gandhabbas..., of yakkhas..., of ghosts... ,^f68 of humans..., of quadrupeds..., of birds..., of reptiles to the reptile state, if there were absolutely no birth at all of all these beings, then, with the absence of all birth, the cessation of birth, could ageing-and-death appear?’ 
‘No, Lord.’ 
׳Therefore, Ananda, just this is the root, the cause, the origin, the condition for ageing-and-death - namely birth.
^n99 ‘I have said: “Becoming conditions birth.״...

If there were absolutely no becoming: in the World of Sense-Desires, of Form or the Formless World...could birth appear?’
‘No, Lord.’ 
‘Therefore just this is the condition of birth — namely becoming.
^n100 ״ ׳Clinging conditions becoming.״... 
If there were absolutely no clinging: 
sensuous clinging, clinging to views, to rite-and-ritual, to personality-belief...

, could becoming appear?
^n101 ״ ׳Craving conditions clinging.״... 
If there were absolutely no craving: 
for sights, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles, mind-objects...

, could clinging appear?
^n102 ״ ׳Feeling conditions craving.״...

If there were absolutely no feeling: feeling born of eye-contact, ear-contact, nose-contact, tongue-contact, body-contact, mind-contact - in the absence of all feeling, with the cessation of feeling, could craving appear?’
‘No, Lord.’ 
׳Therefore, Ananda, just this is the root, the cause, the origin, the condition for craving — namely feeling.
^n103 ‘And so, Ananda, feeling conditions craving, craving conditions seeking,^f69 

^n104 ‘I have said: “All these evil unskilled states arise because of the guarding of possessions.” For if there were absolutely no guarding of possessions... 
would there be the taking up of stick or sword...?’ 
‘No, Lord.’ 
׳Therefore, Ananda, the guarding of possessions is the root, the cause, the origin, the condition for all these evil unskilled states.
^n105 ‘I have said: 


“Avarice conditions the guarding of possessions... ״ 
^n106 ״ ׳Appropriation conditions avarice,... 



^n107 attachment conditions appropriation,...



^n108 lustful desire conditions attachment,... 



^n109 decision-making conditions lustful desire,... 



^n110 acquisition conditions decision-making,... 


seeking conditions acquisition...״ 
^n111 seeking conditions acquisition,^f70 acquisition conditions decision-making,^f71 decision-making conditions lustful desire,^f72 lustful desire conditions attachment,^f73 attachment conditions appropriation,^f74 appropriation conditions avarice,^f75 avarice conditions guarding of possessions, ^f76 
and because of the guarding of possessions there arise the taking up of stick and sword, quarrels, disputes, arguments, strife, abuse, lying and other evil unskilled states.


^n112 ‘I have said: “Craving conditions seeking.”...
If there were no craving,... 
would there be any seeking?’ 
‘No, Lord.’ 
‘Therefore, Ananda, craving is the root, the cause, the origin, the condition for all seeking. 
Thus these two things become united in one by feeling.^f77
^n113 ‘I have said: 
“Contact conditions feeling.”... 


Therefore contact is the root, the cause, the origin, the condition for feeling.
^n114 ‘ “Mind-and-body conditions contact.” By whatever properties, features, signs or indications the mind-factor^f78 is conceived of, would there, in the absence of such properties... 
pertaining to the mind-factor, be manifest any grasping at the idea of the body-factor?׳^f79 
‘No, Lord.’ 
‘Or in the absence of any such properties pertaining to the body-factor, would there be any grasping at sensory reaction on the part of the mind-factor?’ 
‘No, Lord.’
‘By whatever properties the mind-factor and the body-factor are designated — in their absence is there manifested any grasping at the idea, or at sensory reaction?’ 
‘No, Lord.’
‘By whatever properties, features, signs or indications the mind-factor is conceived of, in the absence of these is there any contact to be found?’ 
‘No, Lord.’
‘Then, Ananda, just this, namely mind-and-body, is the root, the cause, the origin, the condition for all contact.
^n115 ‘I have said: “Consciousness conditions mind-and-body.” ... 
If consciousness were not to come into the mother׳s womb, would mind-and-body develop there?’ 
‘No, Lord.’
‘Or if consciousness, having entered the mother’s womb, were to be deflected, would mind-and-body come to birth in this life?’ 
‘No, Lord.’ 
‘And if the consciousness of such a tender young being, boy or girl, were thus cut off, would mind-and-body grow, develop and mature?’ 
‘No, Lord.׳
 ׳Therefore, Ananda, just this, namely consciousness, is the root, the cause, the origin, the condition of mind-and-body.
^n116 ‘I have said: “Mind-and-body conditions consciousness.” ...
If consciousness did not find a resting-place in mind-and-body, would there subsequently be an arising and coming-to-be of birth, ageing, death and suffering?’ 
‘No, Lord.’ 
׳Therefore, Ananda, just this, namely mind-and-body, is the root, the cause, the origin, the condition of consciousness. 
Thus far then, Ananda, we can trace^f80 birth and decay, death and falling into other states and being reborn,^f81 
thus far extends the way of designation, of concepts, thus far is the sphere of understanding, thus far the round goes as far as can be discerned in this life,^f82 namely to mind-and-body together with consciousness.
^n117 ‘In what ways, Ananda, do people explain the nature of the self? 
Some declare the self to be material and limited,^f83 saying: 
“My self is material and limited”; 
some declare it to be material and unlimited...; 

some declare it to be immaterial and limited...; 

some declare it to be immaterial and unlimited, saying: 
“My self is immaterial and unlimited.”
^n118 ‘Whoever declares the self to be material and limited, 
considers it to be so either now, or in the next world, thinking: “Though it is not so now, I shall acquire it there.״^f84 
That being so, that is all we need say about the view that the self is material and limited, and the same applies to the other theories. 
So much, Ananda, for those who proffer an explanation of the self.









^n119 ׳How is it with those who do not explain the nature of the self?...








^n120 (^i[as verses 23 — 24 but negated]). 












^n121 ‘In what ways, Ananda, do people regard the self? 
They equate the self with feeling: 
“Feeling is my self״,^f85 or: 
”Feeling is not my self, my self is impercipient״,^f86 or: 
“Feeling is not my self, but my self is not impercipient, it is of a nature to feel.״^f87 
^n122 ‘Now, Ananda, one who says: 
“Feeling is my self” 
should be told: 
“There are three kinds of feeling, friend: 
pleasant, painful, and neutral. 
Which of the three do you consider to be your self?” 
When a pleasant feeling is felt, no painful or neutral feeling is felt, 
but only pleasant feeling. 
When a painful feeling is felt, no pleasant or neutral feeling is felt, 
but only painful feeling. 
And when a neutral feeling is felt, no pleasant or painful feeling is felt, 
but only neutral feeling.
^n123 ‘Pleasant feeling is impermanent, conditioned,^f88 dependently-arisen, bound to decay, to vanish, to fade away, to cease — 
and so too are painful feeling and neutral feeling. 

So anyone who, on experiencing a pleasant feeling, thinks: “This is my self״, 
must, at the cessation of that pleasant feeling, think: ״My self has gone!” 
and the same with painful and neutral feelings. Thus whoever thinks: “Feeling is my self” 
is contemplating something in this present life that is impermanent, a mixture of happiness and unhappiness, subject to arising and passing away. 
Therefore it is not fitting to maintain: “Feeling is my self.״ 



^n124 ‘But anyone who says: 
“Feeling is not my self, my self is impercipient” should be asked: 
“If, friend, no feelings at all were to be experienced, would there be the thought: ‘I am’?” 〔to which he would have to reply:〕 
“No, Lord.״^f89 
Therefore it is not fitting to maintain: “Feeling is not my self, my self is impercipient.”
^n125 ‘And anyone who says: 
“Feeling is not my self, but my self is not impercipient, my self is of a nature to feel”
 should be asked: 
“Well, friend, if all feelings absolutely and totally ceased, 
could there be the thought: ‘I am this?” ’^f90 
〔to which he would have to reply:〕 “No, Lord.” 
Therefore it is not fitting to maintain: “Feeling is not my self, but my self is not impercipient, my self is of a nature to feel.”
^n126 ‘From the time, Ananda, when a monk no longer regards feeling as the self, or the self as being impercipient, or as being percipient and of a nature to feel, 
by not so regarding, he clings to nothing in the world; 
not clinging, he is not excited by anything, and not being excited he gains personal liberation,^f91 
and he knows: “Birth is finished, the holy life has been led, done was what had to be done, there is nothing more here.”
‘And if anyone were to say to a monk whose mind was thus freed: 
“The Tathāgata exists after death״,^f92 that would be 〔seen by him as〕 a wrong opinion and unfitting, likewise: 
“The Tathāgata does not exist..., 
both exists and does not exist..., 
neither exists nor does not exist after death.” 
Why so? 
As far, Ananda, as designation and the range of designation reaches, as far as language and the range of language reaches, as far as concepts and the range of concepts reaches, as far as understanding and the range of understanding reaches, as far as the cycle reaches and revolves — that monk is liberated from all that by super-knowledge,^f93 and to maintain that such a liberated monk does not know and see would be a wrong view and incorrect.
^n127 ׳Ānanda, there are seven stations of consciousness^f94 and two realms.^f95 
Which are the seven? 
There are beings different in body and different in perception, such as human beings, some devas and some in states of woe. 
That is the first station of consciousness. 
There are beings different in body and alike in perception, such as the devas of Brahmā׳s retinue, born there 〔on account of having attained〕 the first jhāna. 
That is the second station. 
There are beings alike in body and different in perception, such as the Abhassara devas. ^f96 
That is the third station. 
There are beings alike in body and alike in perception, such as the Subhakinna devas. 
That is the fourth station. 
There are beings who have completely transcended all perception of matter, by the vanishing of the perception of sense-reactions and by non-attention to the perception of variety; thinking: “Space is infinite”, they have attained to the Sphere of Infinite Space. 
That is the fifth station. 
There are beings who, by transcending the Sphere of Infinite Space, thinking: “Consciousness is infinite”, have attained to the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness. 
That is the sixth station. 
There are beings who, having transcended the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness, thinking: “There is no thing״, have attained to the Sphere of No-Thingness. 
That is the seventh station of consciousness. 
〔The two realms are:〕 The Realm of Unconscious Beings and, secondly, the Realm of Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception.
^n128 ‘Now, Ananda, as regards this first station of consciousness, with difference of body and difference of perception, as in the case of human beings and so on, 
if anyone were to understand it, its origin, its cessation, its attraction and its peril, and the deliverance from it, would it be fitting for him to take pleasure in it?’ 
‘No, Lord.’ 
‘And as regards the other stations, and ‘.
he two spheres likewise?’ 
‘No, Lord.’
‘Ananda, insofar as a monk, having known as they really are these seven stations of consciousness


 and these two spheres, their origin and cessation, their attraction and peril, is freed without attachment, that monk, Ananda, is called one who is liberated by wisdom.^f97
^n129 ‘There are, Ananda, these eight liberations.^f98 
What are they?
 ׳(1) Possessing form, one sees forms.^f99 
That is the first liberation. 
(2) Not perceiving material forms in oneself, one sees them outside.^f100 
That is the second liberation.
 (3) Thinking: “It is beautiful”, one becomes intent on it.^f101 
That is the third. 
(4) By completely transcending all perception of matter, by the vanishing of the perception of sense-reactions and by non-attention to the perception of variety, thinking: “Space is infinite”, one enters and abides in the Sphere of Infinite Space. 
That is the fourth. 
(5) By transcending the Sphere of Infinite Space, thinking: “Consciousness is infinite”, one enters and abides in the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness. 
That is the fifth. 
(6) By transcending the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness, thinking: “There is no thing״, one enters and abides in the Sphere of No-Thingness. 
That is the sixth. 
(7) By transcending the Sphere of No-Thingness, one reaches and abides in the Sphere of Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception. 
That is the seventh. 
(8) By transcending the Sphere of Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception one enters and abides in the Cessation of Perception and Feeling.^f102
 That is the eighth liberation.

^n130 ‘Ananda, when once a monk attains these eight liberations in forward order, in reverse order, and in forward-and-reverse order, entering them and emerging from them as and when, and for as long as he wishes, 
and has gained by his own super-knowledge here and now both the destruction of the corruptions and the uncorrupted liberation of heart and liberation by wisdom,^f103 that monk is called “both-waysliberatedʺ, ^f104 
and, Ananda, there is no other way of ʺboth-ways-liberationʺ that is more excellent or perfect than this.’
 Thus the Lord spoke. 
And the Venerable Ananda rejoiced and was delighted at his words.

^ck#d16(^z1[Mahāparinibbāna Sutta: The Great Passing] ^h[The Buddha’s Last Days] )^n131 THUS HAVE I HEARD.^f105 
Once the Lord was staying at Rajagaha on the mountain called Vultures’ Peak.^f106
 Now just then King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta^f107 of Magadha wanted to attack the Vajjians.^f108
 He said: 
‘I will strike the Vajjians who are so powerful and strong, I will cut them off and destroy them, I will bring them to ruin and destruction!’
^n132 And King Ajatasattu said to his chief minister the Brahmin Vassakāra: 
‘Brahmin, go to the Blessed Lord, worship him with your head to his feet in my name, ask if he is free from sickness or disease, if he is living at ease, vigorously and comfortably,

 and then say: 
“Lord, King Ajatasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha wishes to attack the Vajjians 
and says: 
‘I will strike the Vajjians...,bring them to ruin and destruction!ʹ
ʺ And whatever the Lord declares to you, report that faithfully back to me, 
for Tathagatas never lie.’
^n133 ‘Very good, Sire’, said Vassakara and, having had the state carriages harnessed, he mounted one of them and drove in state from Rajagaha to Vultures’ Peak, riding as far as the ground would allow, then continuing on foot to where the Lord was. 
He exchanged courtesies with the Lord, then sat down to one side and delivered the King’s message.





^n134 Now the Venerable Ānanda was standing behind the Lord, fanning him. 
And the Lord said: 
‘Ananda, have you heard that the Vajjians hold regular and frequent assemblies?’ 
‘I have heard, Lord, that they do.’
ʹĀnanda, as long as the Vajjians hold regular and frequent assemblies, they may be expected to prosper and not decline. 
Have you heard that the Vajjians meet in harmony, break up in harmony, and carry on their business in harmony?ʹ 
‘I have heard, Lord, that they do.’
‘Ananda, as long as the Vajjians meet in harmony, break up in harmony, and carry on their business in harmony, they may be expected to prosper and not decline. 
Have you heard that the Vajjians do not authorise what has not been authorised already, and do not abolish what has been authorised, but proceed according to what has been authorised by their ancient tradition?’ 
‘I have, Lord.ʹ...
ʹHave you heard that they honour, respect, revere and salute the elders among them, and consider them worth listening to?... 
that they do not forcibly abduct others’ wives and daughters and compel them to live with them?... 

that they honour, respect, revere and salute the Vajjian shrines at home and abroad, not withdrawing the proper support made and given before?... 
that proper provision is made for the safety of Arahants, so that such Arahants may come in future to live there, and those already there may dwell in comfort?’ 
‘I have, Lord.’
‘Ananda, so long as such proper provision is made,...
the Vajjians may be expected to prosper and not decline.’





^n135 Then the Lord said to the Brahmin Vassakāra: 
‘Once, Brahmin, when I was at the Sārandada Shrine in Vesālī, 
I taught the Vajjians these seven principles for preventing decline, 
and as long as they keep to these seven principles, as long as these principles remain in force, the Vajjians may be expected to prosper and not decline.’
At this, Vassakāra replied: 
‘Reverend Gotama, if the Vajjians keep to even one of these principles, they may be expected to prosper and not decline — 
far less all seven. 
Certainly the Vajjians will never be conquered by King Ajātasattu by force of arms, but only by means of propaganda^f109 and setting them against one another. 
And now, Reverend Gotama, may I depart? I am busy and have much to do.’ 
‘Brahmin, do as you think fit.’ 
Then Vassakāra, rejoicing and delighted at the Lord’s words, rose from his seat and departed.
^n136 Soon after Vassakāra had gone, the Lord said: 
‘Ananda, go to whatever monks there are round about Rājagaha, and summon them to the assembly hall.’
 ‘Very good, Lord’, said Ananda, and did so. Then he came to the Lord, saluted him, stood to one side and said: 
‘Lord, the order of monks is assembled. Now is the time for the Lord to do as he sees fit.’ 
Then the Lord rose from his seat, went to the assembly hall, sat down on the prepared seat, 
and said: 
‘Monks, I will teach you seven things that are conducive to welfare.^f110
 Listen, pay careful attention, and I will speak.’ 
‘Yes, Lord’, said the monks, 
and the Lord said:
‘As long as the monks hold regular and frequent assemblies, they may be expected to prosper and not decline. 
As long as they meet in harmony, break up in harmony, and carry on their business in harmony, they may be expected to prosper and not decline. 
As long as they do not authorise what has not been authorised already, and do not abolish what has been authorised, but proceed according to what has been authorised by the rules of training...; 
as long as they honour, respect, revere and salute the elders of long standing who are long ordained, fathers and leaders of the order...; 
as long as they do not fall prey to desires which arise in them and lead to rebirth...; 
as long as they are devoted to forest-lodgings...; 
as long as they preserve their personal mindfulness, so that in future the good among their companions will come to them, and those who have already come will feel at ease with them ...;
 as long as the monks hold to these seven things and are seen to do so, they may be expected to prosper and not decline.
^n137 ‘I will tell you another seven things conducive to welfare... 


As long as monks do not rejoice, delight and become absorbed in works,^f111... 
in chattering,... 
in sleeping,...
in company,...
in evil desires,...in mixing and associating with evil friends,... 
as long as they do not rest content with partial achievements^f112...; 
as long as the monks hold to these seven things and are seen to do so, they may be expected to prosper and not decline.
‘I will tell you another seven things conducive to welfare... 
^n138 As long as monks continue with faith, with modesty, with fear of doing wrong, with learning, with aroused vigour, with established mindfulness, with wisdom...








^n139 ‘I will tell you another seven things...


As long as monks develop the enlightenment-factors of mindfulness, 
of investigation of phenomena, 
of energy, 
of delight, 
of tranquillity, 
of concentration, 
of equanimity...
‘I will tell you another seven things... 
^n140 As long as monks develop the perception of impermanence, 



of non-self, 
of impurity, 
of danger, 
of overcoming, 
of dispassion, 
of cessation, ... 
they may be expected to prosper and not decline.
^n141 ‘Monks, I will tell you six things that are conducive to communal living... 


As long as monks both in public and in private show loving-kindness to their fellows in acts of body, 
speech 
and thought,... 

share with their virtuous fellows whatever they receive as a rightful gift, including the contents of their alms-bowls, which they do not keep to themselves,... 
keep consistently, unbroken and unaltered those rules of conduct that are spotless, leading to liberation, praised by the wise, unstained and conducive to concentration, and persist therein with their fellows both in public and in private,... 
continue in that noble view that leads to liberation, to the utter destruction of suffering, remaining in such awareness with their fellows both in public and in private... 
As long as monks hold to these six things and are seen to do so, they may be expected to prosper and not decline.’
^n142 And then the Lord, while staying at Vultures’ Peak, gave a comprehensive discourse: 
‘This is morality, this is concentration, this is wisdom. 
Concentration, when imbued with morality, brings great fruit and profit. 
Wisdom, when imbued with concentration, brings great fruit and profit. 
The mind imbued with wisdom becomes completely free from the corruptions, 
that is, from the corruption of sensuality, of becoming, of false views and of ignorance.’
^n143 And when the Lord had stayed at Rājagaha as long as he wished, he said to the Venerable Ananda: 
‘Come, Ananda, let us go to Ambalatthikā.’ 
‘Very good, Lord’, said Ananda, 
and the Lord went there with a large company of monks.
And the Lord stayed in the royal park at Ambalatthikā, ^f113 
and there he delivered a comprehensive discourse: 
‘This is morality, this is concentration, this is wisdom...’




^n144 Having stayed at Ambalatthikā as long as he wished, the Lord said to Ananda: 
‘Let us go to Nāḷandāʹ, and they did so. 
At Nāḷandā the Lord stayed in Pāvārikaʹs mango-grove.


^n145 Then the Venerable Sāriputta came to see the Lord, saluted him, sat down to one side, and said: 
‘It is clear to me, Lord, that there never has been, 
will be or is now another ascetic or Brahmin who is better or more enlightened than the Lord.’
‘You have spoken boldly with a bull’s voice, Sāriputta, you have roared the lion’s roar of certainty! 

How is this? 
Have all the Arahant Buddhas of the past appeared to you, and were the minds of all those Lords open to you, so as to say: 
“These Lords were of such virtue, such was their teaching, such their wisdom, such their way, such their liberation”?’ 
‘No, Lord.’
‘And have you perceived all the Arahant Buddhas who will appear in the future...?’ 

‘No, Lord.’
‘Well then, Sāriputta, you know me as the Arahant Buddha, and do you know: 
“The Lord is of such virtue, such is his teaching, such his wisdom, such his way, such his liberation”?’ 
‘No, Lord.’
‘So, Sāriputta, you do not have knowledge of the minds of the Buddhas of the past, the future or the present. 
Thus, Sāriputta, have you not spoken boldly with a bull’s voice and roared the lion’s roar of certainty with your declaration?’

^n146 ‘Lord, the minds of the Arahant Buddhas of the past, future and present are not open to me. 
But I know the drift of the Dhamma.^f114
 Lord, it is as if there were a royal frontier city, with mighty bastions and a mighty encircling wall in which was a single gate, 
at which was a gatekeeper, wise, skilled and clever, who kept out strangers and let in those he knew. 
And he, constantly patrolling and following along a path, might not see the joins and clefts in the bastion, even such as a cat might creep through. 

But whatever larger creatures entered or left the city, must all go through this very gate. 
And it seems to me, Lord, that the drift of the Dhamma is the same. 
All those Arahant Buddhas of the past attained to supreme enlightenment by abandoning the five hindrances, defilements of mind that weaken the understanding, having firmly established the four foundations of mindfulness in their minds, and realised the seven factors of enlightenment as they really are. 
All the Arahant Buddhas of the future will do likewise, and you, Lord, who are now the Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha, have done the same.’

^n147 Then, while staying at Nāḷandā, in Pāvārikaʹs mango-grove, the Lord gave a comprehensive discourse to the monks. 
‘This is morality, this is concentration, this is wisdom...’ 
(^i[as verse 12).]



^n148 And having stayed at Nāḷandā as long as he wished, the Lord said to Ananda: 
‘Let us go to Pāṭaligāma.ʹ 
And they did so.

At Pāṭaligāma they heard say: ‘The Lord has arrived here’. 
And the lay-followers of Pāṭaligāma came to the Lord, saluted him, sat down to one side, and said: 
ʹMay the Lord consent to stay at our rest-house!’ 
And the Lord consented by silence.
Understanding his consent, they rose from their seats, saluted the Lord and, passing him by to the right, went to the rest-house and strewed the floor, prepared seats, provided a water-pot and filled the oil-lamp. Then they went to the Lord, saluted him, stood to one side and said: 
ʹAll is ready at the rest-house, Lord. 
Now is the time to do as the Lord wishes.’ 
Then the Lord dressed, took his robe and bowl, and went with his monks to the rest-house, where he washed his feet, went in and sat down facing east, with his back against the central pillar. 
And the monks, having washed their feet, went in and sat down with their backs to the west wall, facing east, and with the Lord sitting in front of them. 
And the lay-followers of Pāṭaligāma, having washed their feet, went in and sat down with their backs to the east wall, facing west and with the Lord before them.

^n149 Then the Lord addressed the lay-followers of Pāṭaligāma: 
ʹHouseholders, there are these five perils to one of bad morality, of failure in morality. 
What are they? 
In the first place, he suffers great loss of property through neglecting his affairs. 

In the second place, he gets a bad reputation for immorality and misconduct. 

In the third place, whatever assembly he approaches, whether of Khattiyas, Brahmins, householders or ascetics, he does so diffidently and shyly. 

In the fourth place, he dies confused. 

In the fifth place, after death, at the breaking-up of the body, he arises in an evil state, a bad fate, in suffering and hell. 

These are the five perils to one of bad morality.
^n150 ‘And, householders, there are these five advantages to one of good morality and of success in morality. 
What are they? 
In the first place, through careful attention to his affairs he gains much wealth. 

In the second place, he gets a good reputation for morality and good conduct. 

In the third place, whatever assembly he approaches, whether of Khattiyas, Brahmins, householders or ascetics, he does so with confidence and assurance. 

In the fourth place, he dies unconfused. 

In the fifth place, after death, at the breaking-up of the body, he arises in a good place, a heavenly world. 

These are the five advantages to one of good morality, and of success in morality. ʹ 
^n151 Then the Lord instructed, inspired, fired and delighted the lay-followers of Pataligama with talk on Dhamma until far into the night. Then he dismissed them, saying: 
ʹHouseholders, the night is nearly over. Now it is time for you to do as you think fit.’ 
‘Very good, Lord’, they said and, rising and saluting the Lord, they passed him by to the right and departed. 
And the Lord spent the remainder of the night in the rest-house left empty by their departure.
^n152 Now at this time Sunidha and Vassakara, the Magadhan ministers, were building a fortress in Pataligama as a defence against the Vajjians. 
And at that time a multitude of thousands of devas were taking up lodging in Pataligama. 
And in the parts where powerful devas settled, they caused the minds of the most powerful royal officials to pick those sites for their dwellings, 
and where middle 
and lower-ranking devas settled, so too they caused the minds of royal officials of corresponding grade to pick those sites for their dwellings.
And the Lord, with his divine eye surpassing that of humans, saw the thousands of devas taking up residence in Pataligama. 
And, getting up at break of day, he said to the Venerable Ananda: 
‘Ananda, who is building a fortress at Pataligama?’ 
‘Lord, Sunidha and Vassakāra, the Magadhan ministers, are building a fortress against the Vajjians.’
ʹĀnanda, just as if they had taken counsel with the Thirty-Three Gods, Sunidha and Vassakāra are building a fortress at Pātaligāma. 
I have seen with my divine eye how thousands of devas were taking up lodging there... 
(^i[as verse] 26). 



Ānanda, as far as the Ariyan realm extends, as far as its trade extends, this will be the chief city, Pāṭaliputta, scattering its seeds far and wide. 
And Pātaliputta will face three perils: 
from fire, from water and from internal dissension.’
^n153 Then Sunidha and Vassakāra called on the Lord and, having exchanged courtesies, stood to one side 
and said: 
ʹMay the Reverend Gotama accept a meal from us tomorrow with his order of monks!’ 
And the Lord consented by silence.
Understanding his consent, Sunidha and Vassakāra went home and there had a fine meal of hard and soft food prepared. When it was ready, they reported to the Lord: 
‘Reverend Gotama, the meal is ready.’ 
Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, took his robe and bowl, went with the order of monks to the residence of Sunidha and Vassakāra, and sat down on the prepared seat. 
Then Sunidha and Vassakāra served the Buddha and his order of monks with choice soft and hard foods till they were satisfied. 
And when the Lord took his hand away from the bowl they sat down on low stools to one side.
And as they sat there, the Lord thanked them with these verses:
‘In whatever realm the wise man makes his home, 
He should feed the 
virtuous leaders 
of the holy life.
Whatever devas there are
 who report this offering, 
They will pay him respect 
and honour for this. 
They tremble for him 
as a mother for her son, 
And he for whom devas 
tremble ever happy is.’
Then the Lord rose from his seat and took his departure.
^n154 Sunidha and Vassakāra followed closely behind the Lord, saying: 
‘Whichever gate the ascetic Gotama goes out by today, that shall be called the Gotama gate; 
and whichever ford he uses to cross the Ganges, that shall be called the Gotama ford.’ 
And so the gate by which the Lord went out was called the Gotama Gate.
And then the Lord came to the River Ganges. 
And just then, the river was so full that a crow could drink out of it. 
And some people were looking for a boat, and some were looking for a raft, and some were binding together a raft of reeds to get to the other side. 
But the Lord, as swiftly as a strong man might stretch out his flexed arm or flex it again, vanished from this side of the Ganges and reappeared with his order of monks on the other shore.
And the Lord saw those people who were looking for a boat, looking for a raft, and binding together a raft of reeds to get to the other side. 
And seeing their intentions, he uttered this verse on the spot:
‘When they want to cross the sea, 
the lake or pond, 
People make a bridge or raft — 
the wise have crossed already.’
^i[End of first recitation-section] 
^n155 The Lord said to Ananda: 
‘Let us go to Koṭigāma.’ 
‘Very good, Lord’, said Ananda, 
and the Lord went with a large company of monks to Koṭigāma, 
and stayed there.
Then the Lord addressed the monks thus: 
‘Monks, it is through not understanding, not penetrating the Four Noble Truths that I as well as you have for a long time run on and gone round the cycle of birth-and-death. 
What are they? 
By not understanding the Noble Truth of Suffering we have fared on, 
by not understanding the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering, 
of the Cessation of Suffering, 
and of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering we have fared on round the cycle of birth-and-death. 
And by the understanding, the penetration of the same Noble Truth of Suffering, of the Origin of Suffering, of the Cessation of Suffering and of the Path Leading to the Cessation of Suffering, the craving for becoming has been cut off, the support of becoming has been destroyed, there is no more re-becoming.’
The Lord having said this, 
the Well-Farer having spoken, the Teacher said: 
‘Not seeing the 
Four Noble Truths as they are, 
Having long traversed 
the round from life to life, 
These being seen, 
becoming’s supports pulled up, 
Sorrow’s root cut off,
 rebirth is done.’
Then the Lord, while staying at Koṭigāma, gave a comprehensive discourse: 
‘This is morality, this is concentration, this is wisdom. 
Concentration, when imbued with morality, brings great fruit and profit. 
Wisdom, when imbued with concentration, brings great fruit and profit. 
The mind imbued with wisdom becomes completely free from the corruptions, 
that is, from the corruption of sensuality, of becoming, of false views and of ignorance.’
^n156 When the Lord had stayed at Koṭigāma as long as he wished, he said: 
‘Ananda, let us go to Nādikā.’ 
‘Very good, Lord’, said Ananda, 
and the Lord went with a large company of monks to Nādikā, 
where he stayed at the Brick House.^f115
And the Venerable Ananda came to the Lord, saluted him, sat down to one side, and said: 
‘Lord, the monk Sāḷha and the nun Nandā have died at Nadikā. 
What rebirth have they taken after death? 
The lay-follower Sudatta 
and the laywoman-follower Sujātā, 
the lay-followers Kakudha, 
Kalinga, 
Nikata, 
Katissabha, 
Tuttha, 
Santuttha, 
Bhadda and Subhadda have all died in Nādikā. 
What rebirths have they taken?’
^n157 ‘Ananda, the monk Sāḷha, by the destruction of the corruptions, attained in this life, through his own super-knowledge, the uncorrupted liberation of mind, the liberation by wisdom. 
The nun Nandā, by the destruction of the five lower fetters, has been spontaneously reborn,^f116 and will gain Nibbana from that state without returning to this world. 
The lay-follower Sudatta, by the destruction of three fetters and the reduction of greed, hatred and delusion, is a Once-Returner who will come back once more to this world, and then make an end of suffering. 
The laywoman-follower Suj̣̣ātā, by the destruction of three fetters, is a Stream-Winner, incapable of falling into states of woe, certain of attaining Nibbāna. 
The lay-follower Kakudha, by the destruction of the five lower fetters, has been spontaneously reborn, and will gain Nibbāna from that state without returning to this world. 
Likewise Kālinga, 
Nikata, 
Katissabha, 
Tuttha, 
Santuttha, 
Bhadda 
and Subhadda. 
Ananda, in Nādikā more than fifty lay-followers have by the destruction of the five lower fetters been spontaneously reborn, and will gain Nibbāna from that state without returning to this world. 
Rather more than ninety, by the destruction of three fetters and the reduction of greed, hatred and delusion, are Once-Returners who will come back once more to this world and then make an end of suffering. 
And well over five hundred, by the destruction of three fetters, are Stream-Winners, incapable of falling into states of woe, certain of attaining Nibbāna.
^n158 ‘Ānanda, it is not remarkable that that which has come to be as a man should die. 
But that you should come to the Tathāgata to ask the fate of each of those who have died, that is a weariness to him.^f117 
Therefore, Ananda, I will teach you a way of knowing Dhamma, called the Mirror of Dhamma,^f118 whereby the Ariyan disciple, if he so wishes, can discern of himself: 
“I have destroyed hell, animal-rebirth, the realm of ghosts, all downfall, evil fates and sorry states. I am a Stream-Winner, incapable of falling into states of woe, certain of attaining Nibbāna.ʺ 
^n159 ‘And what is this Mirror of Dhamma by which he can know this? 

Here, Ananda, this Ariyan disciple is possessed of unwavering confidence^f119 in the Buddha, thus: 
“This Blessed Lord is an Arahant, a fully-enlightened Buddha, endowed with wisdom and conduct, the Well-Farer, Knower of the worlds, incomparable Trainer of men to be tamed, Teacher of gods and humans, enlightened and blessed.” 
He is possessed of unwavering faith in the Dhamma, thus: 
“Well-proclaimed by the Lord is the Dhamma, visible here and now, timeless, inviting inspection, leading onward, to be comprehended by the wise each one for himself.” 
He is possessed of unwavering confidence in the Sangha, thus: 
ʺWell-directed is the Sangha of the Lord’s disciples, of upright conduct, on the right path, on the perfect path; that is to say the four pairs of persons,^f120 the eight kinds of humans. The Sangha of the Lord’s disciples is worthy of offerings, worthy of hospitality, worthy of gifts, worthy of veneration, an unsurpassed field of merit in the world. 
And he^f121 is possessed of morality dear to the Noble Ones, unbroken, without defect, unspotted, without inconsistency,^f122 liberating, uncorrupted, and conducive to concentration.
‘This, Ānanda, is the Mirror of Dhamma, whereby the Aryan disciple...
can discern of himself: “I have destroyed hell,... I am a Stream-Winner,... certain of attaining Nibbāna.ʺ (^i[as verse 8]) 
Then the Lord, staying at Nādikā in the Brick House, gave a comprehensive discourse to the monks: 
‘This is morality, this is concentration, this is wisdom...’ 
(^i[as verse 2.4).]




^n160 And when the Lord had stayed at Nādikā as long as he wished,...


he went with a large company of monks to Vesali, 
where he stayed at Ambapālīʹs grove.
And there the Lord addressed the monks: 
‘Monks, a monk should be mindful and clearly aware, 
this is our charge to you!
‘And how is a monk mindful?^f123
 Here, a monk abides contemplating the body as body,^f124 earnestly, clearly aware, mindful and having put away all hankering and fretting for the world, 
and likewise with regard to feelings, 
mind 
and mind-objects. 
That is how a monk is mindful.
‘And how is a monk clearly aware? 
Here, a monk, when going forward or backward, is aware of what he is doing; in looking forward or back he is aware of what he is doing; in bending and stretching he is aware of what he is doing; in carrying his inner and outer robe and bowl he is aware of what he is doing; in eating, drinking, chewing and savouring he is aware of what he is doing; in passing excrement or urine he is aware of what he is doing; in walking, standing, sitting or lying down, in keeping awake, in speaking or in staying silent, he is aware of what he is doing. 
That is how a monk is clearly aware. 
A monk should be mindful and clearly aware, 
this is our charge to you!’
^n161 Now Ambapali the courtesan^f125 heard that the Lord had arrived at Vesālī and was staying at her grove. 
She had the best carriages made ready and drove from Vesālī to her park. 
She drove as far as the ground would allow, then alighted and went on foot to where the Lord was. 
She saluted the Lord and sat down to one side, and as she sat, the Lord instructed, inspired, fired and delighted her with a talk on Dhamma. 
And being thus delighted, Ambapālī said: 
‘Lord, may the Lord consent to take a meal from me tomorrow with his order of monks!’ 
The Lord consented by silence,
 and Ambapālī, understanding his acceptance, rose from her seat, saluted the Lord and, passing him by to the right, departed.
And the Licchavis of Vesālī heard that the Lord had arrived at Vesālī and was staying at Ambapālīʹs grove. 
So they had the best carriages made ready and drove out of Vesālī. 
And some of the young Licchavis were all in blue,^f126 with blue make-up,^f127 blue clothes and blue adornment, while some were in yellow, some in red, some in white, with white make-up, white clothes and white adornment.
And Ambapālī met the young Licchavis axle to axle, wheel to wheel, yoke to yoke. 
And they said to her: 
ʹAmbapālī, why do you drive up against us like that?’ 
‘Because, young sirs, the Blessed Lord has been invited by me for a meal with his order of monks.’
‘Ambapālī, give up this meal for a hundred thousand pieces!’ 
‘Young sirs, if you were to give me all Vesālī with its revenues ^f128 I would not give up such an important meal!’
Then the Licchavis snapped their fingers, saying: 
‘We’ve been beaten by the mango-woman,^f129 we’ve been cheated by the mango-woman!’ 
And they set out for Ambapālīʹs grove.
And the Lord, having seen the Licchavis from afar, 
said: 
‘Monks, any of you who have not seen the Thirty-Three Gods, just look at this troop of Licchavis! 
Take a good look at them, 

and you will get an idea of the Thirty-Three Gods!’
Then the Licchavis drove in their carriages as far as the ground would allow, then they alighted and went on foot to where the Lord was, saluted him and sat down to one side. 
And as they sat, the Lord instructed, inspired, fired and delighted them with a talk on Dhamma. 
And being thus delighted, they said: 
‘Lord, may the Lord consent to take a meal from us tomorrow with his order of monks!’ 
‘But, Licchavis, 
I have already accepted a meal for tomorrow from the courtesan Ambapālī! ’ 
And the Licchavis snapped their fingers, saying: 
‘We’ve been beaten by the mango-woman, we’ve been cheated by the mango-woman!’ 
Then, having rejoiced and delighted in his talk, they rose from their seats, saluted the Lord and, passing him by on the right, departed.
^n162 And Ambapālī, when night was nearly over, having had choice hard and soft food prepared at her home,
 announced to the Lord that the meal was ready. 
Having dressed and taken robe and bowl, the Lord went with the order of monks to Ambapālīʹs residence and sat down on the prepared seat. 
And she served the Buddha and his monks with choice hard and soft food till they were satisfied. 
And when the Lord had taken his hand from the bowl, Ambapālī took a low stool and sat down to one side. 
So seated, she said: 
‘Lord, I give this park to the order of monks with the Buddha as its head.’ 
The Lord accepted the park, 
and then he instructed, inspired, fired and delighted her with a talk on Dhamma, after which he rose from his seat and departed.
Then, while staying at Vesālī, the Lord delivered a comprehensive discourse to the monks: 
‘This is morality, this is concentration, this is wisdom...’ 
^i[(as verse 2.4).]



^n163 And when the Lord had stayed at Ambapālīʹs grove as long as he wished,...


he went with a large company of monks to the little village of Beluva, 
where he stayed.
There the Lord said to the monks: 
‘You, monks, should go to anywhere in Vesālī 
where you have friends or acquaintances or supporters, and spend the Rains there. I shall spend the Rains here in Beluva.ʹ 
ʹVery good, Lord’, replied the monks, 
and they did so, but the Lord spent the Rains in Beluva.
^n164 And during the Rains the Lord was attacked by a severe sickness, with sharp pains as if he were about to die. 
But he endured all this mindfully, clearly aware and without complaining. 
He thought: 
‘It is not fitting that I should attain final Nibbāna without addressing my followers and taking leave of the order of monks. 
I must hold this disease in check by energy and apply myself to the force of life.’ 
He did so, and the disease abated.
Then the Lord, having recovered from his sickness, 
as soon as he felt better, went outside and sat on a prepared seat in front of his dwelling. Then the Venerable Ananda came to him, saluted him, sat down to one side 
and said: 
‘Lord, I have seen the Lord in comfort, and I have seen the Lord’s patient enduring. And, Lord, my body was like a drunkard’s. I lost my bearings and things were unclear to me because of the Lord’s sickness. 
The only thing that was some comfort to me was the thought: 
“The Lord will not attain final Nibbana until he has made some statement about the order of monks.
^n165 ‘But, Ananda, what does the order of monks expect of me? I have taught the Dhamma, Ananda, 
making no “inner” and ʺouterʺ:^f130 
the Tathagata has no “teacher’s fist” in respect of doctrines. 
If there is anyone who thinks: 
“I shall take charge of the orderʺ,^f131 or “The order should refer to me”, let him make some statement about the order, 
but the Tathagata does not think in such terms. 

So why should the Tathagata make a statement about the order?
ʹĀnanda, I am now old, worn out, venerable, one who has traversed life’s path, I have reached the term of life,
 which is eighty.^f132
 Just as an old cart is made to go by being held together with straps,^f133 
so the Tathagata’s body is kept going by being strapped up. 
It is only when the Tathagata withdraws his attention from outward signs,^f134 and by the cessation of certain feelings,^f135 enters into the signless concentration of mind,^f136 that his body knows comfort.
‘Therefore, Ananda, you should live as islands^f137 unto yourselves, being your own refuge, with no on else as your refuge, with the Dhamma as an island, with the Dhamma as your refuge, with no other refuge. 
And how does a monk live as an island unto himself,... 
with no other refuge? 
Here, Ānanda, a monk abides contemplating the body as body, earnestly, clearly aware, mindful and having put away all hankering and fretting for the world, and likewise with regard to feelings, 
mind 
and mind-objects. 
That, Ananda, is how a monk lives as an island unto himself,... with no other refuge. 
And those who now in my time or afterwards live thus, they will become the highest,^f138 if they are desirous of learning.’
 ^i[End of second recitation-section] 
^n166 Then the Lord, rising early, dressed, took his robe and bowl, and entered Vesali for alms. Having eaten on his return from the alms-round, 
he said to the Venerable Ananda: 
‘Bring a mat, Ananda. 
We will go to the Capala Shrine for the siesta.’ 
‘Very good, Lord’, said Ananda, and, getting a mat, he followed behind.
Then the Lord came to the Cāpāla Shrine, and sat down on the prepared seat. 
Ānanda saluted the Lord and sat down to one side, 
^n167 and the Lord said: 
 ‘Ananda, Vesālī is delightful, the Udena Shrine is delightful, the Gotamaka Shrine is delightful, the Sattambaka^f139 Shrine is delightful, the Bahuputta^f140 Shrine is delightful, the Cāpāla Shrine is delightful. 
‘Ananda, whoever has developed the four roads to power,^f141 practised them frequently, made them his vehicle, made them his base, established them, become familiar with them and properly undertaken them, could undoubtedly live for a century,^f142 or the remainder of one. 
The Tathāgata has developed these powers,... properly undertaken them. And he could, Ananda, undoubtedly live for a century, or the remainder of one.’
But the Venerable Ananda, failing to grasp this broad hint, this clear sign, 
did not beg the Lord: 
‘Lord, may the Blessed Lord stay for a century, may the Well-Farer stay for a century for the benefit and happiness of the multitude, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit and happiness of devas and humans’, so much was his mind possessed by Māra.^f143
And a second time...
, and a third time...
^i[(as verses 3 — ] 4). 





Then the Lord said: 
‘Ananda, go now 
and do what seems fitting to you.’ 
‘Very good, Lord’, said Ananda and, rising from his seat, he saluted the Lord, passed by on the right and sat down under a tree some distance away.
^n168 Soon after Ananda had left, Māra the Evil One came to the Lord, stood to one side, and said:
 ‘Lord, may the Blessed Lord now attain final Nibbāna, may the Well-Farer now attain final Nibbāna. Now is the time for the Blessed Lord’s final Nibbana. 
Because the Blessed Lord has said this: 
“Evil One, I will not take final Nibbana till I have monks and disciples who are accomplished, trained, skilled, learned, knowers of the Dhamma, trained in conformity with the Dhamma, correctly trained and walking in the path of the Dhamma, who will pass on what they have gained from their Teacher, teach it, declare it, establish it, expound it, analyse it, make it clear; till they shall be able by means of the Dhamma to refute false teachings that have arisen, and teach the Dhamma of wondrous effect.ʺ^f144 
‘And now, Lord, the Blessed Lord has such monks and disciples. 
May the Blessed Lord now attain final Nibbāna, may the Well-Farer now attain final Nibbāna. 
Now is the time for the Blessed Lord’s final Nibbāna. And the Blessed Lord has said: 
“I will not take final Nibbāna till I have nuns and female disciples who are accomplished,... 



till I have laymen-followers,... 



till I have laywomen-followers...” (^i[as verse 7).]

 May the Blessed Lord now take final Nibbāna...
And the Blessed Lord has said: 
“Evil One, I will not take final Nibbāna till this holy life has been successfully established and flourishes, is widespread, well-known far and wide, well-proclaimed among mankind everywhere.” 
And all this has come about. 
May the Blessed Lord now attain final Nibbāna, may the Well-Farer now attain final Nibbāna. Now is the time for the Blessed Lord’s final Nibbāna.ʹ 
At this the Lord said to Māra: 
‘You need not worry, Evil One. The Tathāgataʹs final passing will not be long delayed. 
Three months from now, the Tathāgata will take final Nibbana.’
^n169 So the Lord, at the Cāpāla Shrine, mindfully and in full awareness renounced the life-principle,
 and when this occurred there was a great earthquake, terrible, hair-raising and accompanied by thunder. 
And when the Lord saw this he uttered this verse:
‘Gross or fine, 
things become the sage abjured. 
Calm, composed, 
he burst becoming’s shell.ʹ^f145 
^n170 And the Venerable Ananda thought: 
‘It is marvellous, it is wonderful how this great earthquake arises, 
this terrible earthquake, so dreadful and hair-raising, accompanied by thunder! 
Whatever can have caused it?’
He went to the Lord, 
saluted him, sat down to one side, 
and asked him that question.




^n171 ʹĀnanda, there are eight reasons, eight causes for the appearance of a great earthquake. 

This great earth is established on water, the water on the wind, the wind on space. And when a mighty wind blows, this stirs up the water, and through the stirring-up of the water the earth quakes. 
That is the first reason.
‘In the second place there is an ascetic or Brahmin who has developed psychic powers, or a mighty and powerful deva whose earth-consciousness is weakly developed and his water-consciousness is immeasurable,^f146 and he makes the earth shudder and shake and violently quake. 
That is the second reason.
‘Again, when a Bodhisatta descends from the Tusita Heaven, mindful and clearly aware, into his mother’s womb, then the earth shudders and shakes and violently quakes. 
That is the third reason.
‘Again, when the Bodhisatta emerges from his mother’s womb, mindful and clearly aware, then the earth shudders and shakes and violently quakes. 
That is the fourth reason.
‘Again, when the Tathagata gains unsurpassed enlightenment, then the earth shudders and shakes and violently quakes. 
That is the fifth reason.
‘Again, when the Tathagata sets in motion the Wheel of the Dhamma, then the earth shudders and shakes and violently quakes. 
That is the sixth reason.
‘Again, when the Tathagata, mindful and clearly aware, renounces the life-principle, then the earth shudders and shakes and violently quakes.
‘Again, when the Tathagata gains the Nibbānaelement without remainder,^f147 then the earth shudders and shakes and violently quakes. 
That is the eighth reason. 
These, Ānanda, are the eight reasons, the eight causes for the appearance of a great earthquake.

^n172 ʹĀnanda, these eight 〔kinds of〕 assemblies. 
What are they? 
They are the assembly of Khattiyas, the assembly of Brahmins, the assembly of householders, the assembly of ascetics, the assembly of devas of the Realm of the Four Great Kings, the assembly of the Thirty-Three Gods, the assembly of maras, the assembly of Brahmas.
‘I remember well, Ananda, many hundreds of assemblies of Khattiyas^f148 that I have attended;
 and before I sat down with them, spoke to them or joined in their conversation, 
I adopted their appearance and speech, whatever it might be. 
And I instructed, inspired, fired and delighted them with a discourse on Dhamma. 
And as I spoke with them they did not know me and wondered: 
“Who is it that speaks like this — a deva or a man?” 
And having thus instructed them, I disappeared, 
and still they did not know: 
“He who has just disappeared — was he a deva or a man?”
‘I remember well many hundreds of assemblies of Brahmins, 
of householders, 
of ascetics, 
of devas of the Realm of the Four Great Kings, 
of the Thirty-Three Gods, 
of maras, 
of Brahmās...
, and still they did not know: 




“He who has just disappeared — was he a deva or a man?” 



Those, Ananda, are the eight assemblies.
^n173 ‘Ananda, there are eight stages of mastery.^f149 
What are they?
‘Perceiving forms internally,^f150 one sees external forms, limited and beautiful or ugly, 
and in mastering these, one is aware that one knows and sees them. 
That is the first stage.
‘Perceiving forms internally, one sees external forms, unlimited and beautiful or ugly...
 (as verse 25). 
That is the second stage.
‘Not perceiving forms internally, one sees external forms, limited and beautiful or ugly...
(as verse 25). 
That is the third stage.
‘Not perceiving forms internally, one sees external forms, unlimited and beautiful or ugly, and in mastering these, 
one is aware that one knows and sees them. 
That is the fourth stage.
‘Not perceiving forms internally, one sees external forms that are blue, of blue colour, of blue lustre. 
Just as a flax flower which is blue, of blue colour, of blue lustre, or a Benares cloth smoothed on both sides that is blue,... 
so one perceives external forms that are blue,... 
and in mastering these, one is aware that one knows and sees them. 
That is the fifth stage.
‘Not perceiving forms internally, one sees external forms that are yellow...
Just as a ^i[kaṇṇikāra]^f151 flower which is yellow,... 
or a Benares cloth that is yellow, so one perceives external forms that are yellow...

That is the sixth stage. 
‘Not perceiving forms internally, one sees external forms that are red... Just as a hibiscus flower which is red,... 
or a Benares cloth which is red,... 

so one perceives external forms that are red... 
That is the seventh stage.
‘Not perceiving forms internally, one sees external forms that are white, of white colour, of white lustre, 
just as the morning-star Osadhi^f152 is white,... or a Benares cloth smoothed on both sides that is white,... 
so not perceiving forms internally, one sees external forms that are white,...
and in mastering these, one is aware that one knows and sees them. 
That is the eighth stage of mastery. 
These, Ananda, are the eight stages of mastery.
^n174 ‘There are, Ananda, these eight liberations. 
What are they? 
Possessing form, one sees forms. 
That is the first. 
Not perceiving material forms in oneself, one sees them outside. 
That is the second. 
Thinking: “It is beautiful”, one becomes intent on it. 
That is the third. 
By completely transcending all perception of matter,... thinking: “Space is infinite”, one enters and abides in the Sphere of Infinite Space. 
That is the fourth. 
By transcending the Sphere of Infinite Space, thinking: “Consciousness is infinite”, one enters and abides in the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness. 
That is the fifth. 
By transcending the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness, thinking: “There is no thingʺ, one enters and abides in the Sphere of No-Thingness. 
That is the sixth. 
By transcending the Sphere of No-Thingness, one reaches and abides in the Sphere of Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception. 
That is the seventh. 
By transcending the Sphere of Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception, one enters and abides in the Cessation of Perception and Feeling. 
That is the eighth liberation
 ^i[(as Sutta 15, verse 35).]

^n175 ʹĀnanda, once I was staying at Uruvelā on the bank of the River Nerañjarā, under the Goatherd’s Banyan-tree, when I had just attained supreme enlightenment. 
And Māra the Evil One came to me, stood to one side and said: 
ʺMay the Blessed Lord now attain final Nibbāna, may the Well-Farer now attain final Nibbāna. Now is the time for the Blessed Lord’s final Nibbāna.ʺ 
‘At this I said to Māra: 
“Evil One, I will not take final Nibbāna till I have monks and disciples who are accomplished, trained, skilled, learned, knowers of the Dhamma,... ^i[(as] verse 7), 
till I have nuns...
, laymen-followers, 
laywomen-followers who will ... teach the Dhamma of wondrous effect. 
I will not take final Nibbana till this holy life has been successfully established and flourishes, is widespread, well-known far and wide, well-proclaimed among mankind everywhere.”
^n176 ‘And just now, today, Ananda, at the Cāpāla Shrine, Mara came to me, stood to one, side and said: 
“Lord, may the Blessed Lord now attain final Nibbana...
Now is the time for the Blessed Lord’s final Nibbana.”







^n177 ‘And I said: 
“You need not worry, Evil One. 
Three months from now the Tathagata will take final Nibbana.” 
So now, today, Ananda, at the Cāpāla Shrine, the Tathagata has mindfully and in full awareness renounced the life-principle.’ 
^n178 At this the Venerable Ananda said: 
‘Lord, may the Blessed Lord stay for a century, may the Well-Farer stay for a century for the benefit and happiness of the multitude, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit and happiness of devas and humans!’ 
‘Enough, Ananda! 
Do not beg the Tathāgata, it is not the right time for that!’
And a second 
and a third time the Venerable Ananda made the same request. 
‘Ānanda, have you faith in the Tathagata’s enlightenment?’ 
‘Yes, Lord.’

‘Then why do you bother the Tathagata with your request up to three times?’
‘But Lord, I have heard from the Lord’s own lips, I have understood from the Lord’s own lips: 
“Whoever has developed the four roads to power... 
could undoubtedly live for a century, or for the remainder of one.”’
‘Have you faith, Ananda?’ 
‘Yes, Lord.’
‘Then, Ananda, yours is the fault, yours is the failure that, having been given such a broad hint, such a clear sign by the Tathagata, you did not understand and did not beg the Tathāgata to stay for a century... 

If, Ananda, you had begged him, the Tathagata would twice have refused you, but the third time he would have consented. 
Therefore, Ananda, yours is the fault, yours is the failure.
^n179 ‘Once, Ananda, I was staying at Rājagaha, at the Vultures’ Peak. 
And there I said: 
“Ānanda, Rājagaha is delightful, the Vultures’ Peak is delightful. 
Whoever has developed the four roads to power...
could undoubtedly live for a century...”(^i[as verse 3]). 
But you, Ananda, in spite of such a broad hint did not understand and did not beg the Tathāgata to stay for a century ...



^n180 ‘Once I was staying at Rājagaha in the Banyan Park..., 
at Robbers’ Cliff..., 
at the Satapanni Cave on the side of Mount Vebhāra..., 
at the Black Rock on the slope of Mount Isigili ... , 
at the slope by the Snakes’ Pool in Cool Wood..., 
at the Tapodā Park..., 
at the Squirrels’ Feeding-Ground in Veḷuvana..., 
in Jīvaka’s mango-grove ... , 
and also at Rājagaha in the Maddakucchi deer-park.
‘At all these places I said to you: 
“Ānanda, this place is delightful...” 

‘“Whoever has developed the four roads to power... 
could undoubtedly live for a century... 
”(^i[as verse 3]).


^n181 ‘Once I was at Vesālī at the Udena Shrine...







^n182 ‘Once I was at Vesālī at the Gotamaka Shrine ... ,
 at the Sattambaka Shrine ... , 
at the Bahuputta Shrine..., 
at the Sārandada Shrine...‘
And now today at the Cāpāla Shrine I said: 
“These places are delightful. Ānanda, whoever has developed the four roads to power... 
could undoubtedly live for a century, or the remainder of one. 
The Tathāgata has developed these powers ... and he could, Ananda, undoubtedly live for a century, or the remainder of one.”
‘But you, Ananda, failing to grasp this broad hint, this clear sign, did not beg the Tathāgata to stay for a century. 

If, Ananda, you had begged him, the Tathāgata would twice have refused you, but the third time he would have consented.

^n183 ‘Ānanda, have I not told you before: 
All those things that are dear and pleasant to us must suffer change, separation and alteration? 
So how could this be possible? Whatever is born, become, compounded, is liable to decay - that it should not decay is impossible. 
And that has been renounced, given up, rejected, abandoned, forsaken: the Tathagata has renounced the life-principle. The Tathagata has said once for all: 
“The Tathāgata’s final passing will not be long delayed. 
Three months from now the Tathagata will take final Nibbana. ” 
That the Tathagata should withdraw such a declaration in order to live on, is not possible.^f153
 Now come, Ananda, we will go to the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest.’ 
‘Very good, Lord.’
And the Lord went with the Venerable Ananda to the Gabled Hall in the Great Forest. When he got there, he said: 
‘Ananda, go and gather together all the monks living in the vicinity of Vesālī, and get them to come to the assembly hall.’ 
‘Very good, Lord’, said Ananda, and did so. 
He then returned to the Lord, saluted him, stood to one side and said: ‘Lord, the order of monks is gathered together. 
Now is the time for the Lord to do as he wishes.’
^n184 Then the Lord entered the assembly hall and sat down on the prepared seat. 
Then he said to the monks: 
‘Monks, for this reason those matters which I have discovered and proclaimed should be thoroughly learnt by you, practised, developed and cultivated, so that this holy life may endure for a long time, that it may be for the benefit and happiness of the multitude, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit and happiness of devas and humans. 
And what are those matters ... ? They are: 
The four foundations of mindfulness, the four right efforts, the four roads to power, the five spiritual faculties,^f154 the five mental powers ^f155 the seven factors of enlightenment, the Noble Eightfold Path.’^f156

^n185 Then the Lord said to the monks: 
‘And now, monks, I declare to you — 
all conditioned things are of a nature to decay — strive on untiringly. 
The Tathagata’s final passing will not be long delayed. 
Three months from now the Tathāgata will take his final Nibbāna.’
Thus the Lord spoke. 
The Well-Farer having thus spoken, the Teacher said this:
‘Ripe I am in years. 
My life-span’s determined. 
Now I go from you, 
having made myself my refuge. 
Monks, be untiring, mindful, disciplined, 
Guarding your minds 
with well-collected thought. 
He who, tireless, 
keeps to law 
and discipline, 
Leaving birth behind 
will put an end to woe.’
^i[End of third recitation-section] 
^n186 Then the Lord, having risen early and dressed, took his robe and bowl and went into Vesali for alms. 
Having returned from the alms-round and eaten, he looked back at Vesālī with his ‘elephant-look’^f157 and said: 
‘Ananda, this is the last time the Tathagata will look upon Vesālī. 
Now we will go to Bhandagāma.’ 
‘Very good, Lord’, said Ananda, 
and the Lord proceeded with a large company of monks to Bhandagama, 
and stayed there.
And there the Lord addressed the monks: 
‘It is, monks, through not understanding, not penetrating four things that I as well as you have for a long time fared on round the cycle of rebirths. 
What are the four? 
Through not understanding the Ariyan morality, 
through not understanding the Ariyan concentration, 
through not understanding the Ariyan wisdom, 
through not understanding the Ariyan liberation,^f158 
I as well as you have for a long time fared on round the cycle of rebirths. And it is by understanding and penetrating the Ariyan morality, the Ariyan concentration, the Ariyan wisdom and the Ariyan liberation that the craving for becoming has been cut off, the tendency towards becoming has been exhausted, and there will be no more rebirth.’
Thus the Lord spoke. 
The Well-Farer having thus spoken, the Teacher said this:
‘Morality, samadhi, wisdom 
and final release, 
These glorious things 
Gotama came to know. 
The Dhamma he’d discerned 
he taught his monks: 
He whose vision ended 
woe to Nibbana’s gone.’
Then the Lord, while staying at Bhaṇḍagāma, delivered a comprehensive discourse: 
‘This is morality, this is concentration, this is wisdom. 
Concentration, when imbued with morality, brings great fruit and profit. 
Wisdom, when imbued with concentration, brings great fruit and profit. 
The mind imbued with wisdom becomes completely free from the corruptions, 
that is, from the corruption of sensuality, of becoming, of false views and of ignorance.’
^n187 And when the Lord had stayed at Bhaṇḍagāma for as long as he wished, he said: 
‘Ānanda, let us go to Hatthigama ... , 
to Ambagāma ... , 
to Jambugāma ...’ giving the same discourse at each place. 
Then he said: ‘Ānanda, let us go to Bhoganagara.’
‘Very good, Lord’, said Ananda, 
and the Lord went with a large company of monks to Bhoganagara.
At Bhoganagara the Lord stayed at the Ananda Shrine. 
And here he said to the monks: 
‘Monks, I will teach you four criteria. 
Listen, pay close attention, and I will speak.’ 
‘Yes, Lord’, replied the monks.

^n188 ‘Suppose a monk were to say: 
“Friends, I heard and received this from the Lord’s own lips: 
this is the Dhamma, this is the discipline, this is the Master’s teaching^i[”,] 
then, monks, you should neither approve nor disapprove his words. 
Then, without approving or disapproving, his words and expressions should be carefully noted and compared with the Suttas and reviewed in the light of the discipline. 
If they, on such comparison and review, are found not to conform to the Suttas or the discipline, the conclusion must be: 
“Assuredly this is not the word of the Buddha, 
it has been wrongly understood by this monk”
, and the matter is to be rejected. 
But where on such comparison and review they are found to conform to the Suttas or the discipline, the conclusion must be: 
“Assuredly this is the word of the Buddha, 
it has been rightly understood by this monk.” 
This is the first criterion.
‘Suppose a monk were to say: 
“In such and such a place there is a community with elders and distinguished teachers. 
I have heard and received this from that community”
, then, monks, you should neither approve nor disapprove his words ... 
(^i[as verse 4.8]). 








That is the second criterion.
‘Suppose a monk were to say: 
“In such and such a place there are many elders who are learned, bearers of the tradition, who know the Dhamma, the discipline, the code of rules...” 
(^i[as verse 4.8]). 











This is the third criterion.
‘Suppose a monk were to say: 
“In such and such a place there is one elder who is learned ... 
I have heard and received this from that elder...” 
(^i[as verse 4.8)]. 

But where on such comparison and review they are found to conform to the Suttas and the discipline, then the conclusion must be: 
‘Assuredly this is the word of the Buddha, it has been rightly understood by this monk.’








Then the Lord, while staying at Bhoganagara, delivered a comprehensive discourse: 
‘This is morality, this is concentration, this is wisdom...’




^n189 And when the Lord had stayed at Bhoganagara for as long as he wished, he said: 
‘Ananda, let us go to Pāvā.’ 
‘Very good, Lord’, said Ananda, 
and the Lord went with a large company of monks to Pāvā, 
where he stayed at the mango-grove of Cunda the smith.
And Cunda heard that the Lord had arrived at Pāvā and was staying at his mango-grove. 
So he went to the Lord, saluted him and sat down to one side, 
and the Lord instructed, inspired, fired and delighted him with a talk on Dhamma.
Then Cunda said: 
‘May the Lord accept a meal from me tomorrow with his order of monks!’ 
And the Lord consented by silence.
And Cunda, understanding his consent, rose from his seat, saluted the Lord and, passing by to the right, departed. 
And as the night was ending Cunda had a fine meal of hard and soft food prepared with an abundance of ‘pig’s delight ^i[’,]^f159 and when it was ready he reported to the Lord: 
‘Lord, the meal is ready.’ 
Then the Lord, having dressed in the morning, took his robe and bowl and went with his order of monks to Cunda’s dwelling, where he sat down on the prepared seat 
and said: 
‘Serve the “pig’s delight” that has been prepared to me, 
and serve the remaining hard and soft food to the order of monks.’ 
‘Very good, Lord’, said Cunda, 
and did so.
Then the Lord said to Cunda: 
‘Whatever is left over of the “pig’s delight” you should bury in a pit, 
because, Cunda, I can see none in this world with its devas, māras and Brahmās, in this generation with its ascetics and Brahmins, its princes and people who, if they were to eat it, could thoroughly digest it except the Tathāgata.’^f160
 ‘Very good, Lord’, said Cunda and, having buried the remains of the ‘pig’s delight’ in a pit, he came to the Lord, saluted him and sat down to one side. 
Then the Lord, having instructed, inspired, fired and delighted him with a talk on Dhamma, rose from his seat and departed.

^n190 And after having eaten the meal provided by Cunda, the Lord was attacked by a severe sickness with bloody diarrhoea, and with sharp pains as if he were about to die. 
But he endured all this mindfully and clearly aware, and without complaint. 
Then the Lord said: 
‘Ananda, let us go to Kusinara.’ 
‘Very good, Lord’, said Ananda.
Having eaten 
Cunda’s meal (this I’ve heard), 
He suffered a grave illness, 
painful, deathly; 
From eating a meal of ‘pig’s delight’ 
Grave sickness assailed the Teacher. 
Having purged, the Lord then said: 
‘Now I’ll go to Kusinārā town.’^f161
^n191 Then turning aside from the road, the Lord went to the foot of a tree and said: 
‘Come, Ananda, fold a robe in four for me: I am tired and want to sit down.’ 
‘Very good, Lord’, said Ananda, and did so.
The Lord sat down on the prepared seat 
and said: 
‘Ananda, bring me some water: I am thirsty and want to drink.’ 
Ananda replied: 
‘Lord, five hundred carts have passed this way. The water is churned up by their wheels and is not good, it is dirty and disturbed. 
But, Lord, the River Kakutthā nearby has clean water, pleasant, cool, pure, with beautiful banks, delightful. 
There the Lord shall drink the water and cool his limbs.’
A second time the Lord said: 
‘Ananda, bring me some water...’
, and Ananda replied as before.



A third time the Lord said: 
‘Ananda, bring me some water: I am thirsty and want to drink.’ 
‘Very good, Lord’, said Ānanda and, taking his bowl, he went to the stream. 
And that stream whose water had been churned up by the wheels and was not good, dirty and disturbed, as Ananda approached it began to flow pure, bright and unsullied.
And the Venerable Ananda thought: 
‘Wonderful, marvellous are the Tathagata’s great and mighty powers! 
This water was churned up by wheels..., and at my approach it flows pure, bright and unsullied!’ 
He took water in his bowl, brought it to the Lord and told him of his thought, saying: 
‘May the Lord drink the water, may the Well-Farer drink!’ 
And the Lord drank the water. 


^n192 At that moment Pukkusa the Malla, a pupil of Ālāra Kālāma,^f162 was going along the main road from Kusinara to Pava. 
Seeing the Lord sitting under a tree, he went over, saluted him and sat down to one side. 
Then he said: 
‘It is wonderful, Lord, it is marvellous how calm these wanderers are!
‘Once, Lord, Ālāra Kālāma was going along the main road and, turning aside, he went and sat down under a nearby tree to take his siesta. 
And five hundred carts went rumbling by very close to him. 
A man who was walking along behind them came to Āḷāra Kālāma and said: 
“Lord, did you not see five hundred carts go by?” 
“No, friend, I did not.” 
“But didn’t you hear them, Lord?” 
“No, friend, I did not.” 
“Well, were you asleep, Lord?” 
“No, friend, I was not asleep.” 
“Then, Lord, were you conscious?” 
“Yes, friend”. 
“So, Lord, being conscious and awake you neither saw nor heard five hundred carts passing close by you, 
even though your outer robe was bespattered with dust?” 
“That is so, friend.”
‘And that man thought: 
“It is wonderful, it is marvellous! 
These wanderers are so calm that though conscious and awake, a man neither saw nor heard five hundred carts passing close by him!” 
And he went away praising Āḷāra Kālāma’s lofty powers.’
^n193 ‘Well, Pukkusa, what do you think? 
What do you consider is more difficult to do or attain to - 
while conscious and awake not to see or hear five hundred carts passing nearby or, while conscious and awake, 
not to see or hear anything when the rain-god streams and splashes, when lightning flashes and thunder crashes?’
‘Lord, how can one compare not seeing or hearing five hundred carts with that - or even six, seven, eight, nine or ten hundred, or hundreds of thousands of carts to that? 
To see or hear nothing when such a storm rages is more difficult...’
‘Once, Pukkusa, when I was staying at Atuma, 
at the threshing-floor, the rain-god streamed and splashed, lightning flashed and thunder crashed, and two farmers, brothers, and four oxen were killed. 
And a lot of people went out of Atuma to where the two brothers and the four oxen were killed.
‘And, Pukkusa, I had at that time gone out of the door of the threshing-floor and was walking up and down outside. 
And a man from the crowd came to me, saluted me and stood to one side. And I said to him:
‘“Friend, why are all these people gathered here?” 
“Lord, there has been a great storm and two farmers, brothers, and four oxen have been killed. 

But you, Lord, where have you been?” 
“I have been right here, friend.” 
“But what did you see, Lord?” 
“I saw nothing, friend.” 
“Or what did you hear, Lord?” 
“I heard nothing, friend.” 
“Were you sleeping, Lord?” 
“I was not sleeping, friend.” 
“Then, Lord, were you conscious?” 
“Yes, friend.” 
“So, Lord, being conscious and awake you neither saw nor heard the great rainfall and floods and the thunder and lightning?” 
“That is so, friend.”
‘And, Pukkusa, that man thought: 
“It is wonderful, it is marvellous! 
These wanderers are so calm that they neither see nor hear when the rain-god streams and splashes, lightning flashes and thunder crashes!” 
Proclaiming my lofty powers, he saluted me, passed by to the right and departed.’
At this, Pukkusa the Malla said: 
‘Lord, I reject the lofty powers of Āḷāra Kalama as if they were blown away by a mighty wind or carried off by a swift stream or river! 
Excellent, Lord, excellent! 
It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there. Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways. 
And I, Lord, go for refuge to the Blessed Lord, the Dhamma and the Sangha. 
May the Blessed Lord accept me from this day forth as a lay-follower as long as life shall last!’
^n194 Then Pukkusa said to one man: 
‘Go and fetch me two fine sets of robes of cloth-of-gold, burnished and ready to wear.’ ‘Yes, Lord’, 
the man replied, and did so. 
And Pukkusa offered the robes to the Lord, saying: 
‘Here, Lord, are two fine sets of robes of cloth-of-gold. May the Blessed Lord be graciously pleased to accept them!’ 
‘Well then, Pukkusa, clothe me in one set and Ananda in the other.’ 
‘Very good, Lord’, said Pukkusa, and did so.^f163
Then the Lord instructed, inspired, fired and delighted Pukkusa the Malla with a talk on Dhamma. 
Then Pukkusa rose from his seat, saluted the Lord, passed by to the right, and departed.
^n195 Soon after Pukkusa had gone, Ānanda, having arranged one set of the golden robes on the body of the Lord, 
observed that against the Lord’s body it appeared dulled. 
And he said: 
‘It is wonderful, Lord, it is marvellous how clear and bright the Lord’s skin appears! 
It looks even brighter than the golden robes in which it is clothed.’
 ‘Just so, Ananda. There are two occasions on which the Tathāgata’s skin appears especially clear and bright. 
Which are they? 
One is the night in which the Tathāgata gains supreme enlightenment, the other is the night when he attains the Nibbāna-element without remainder at his final passing. 
On these two occasions the Tathāgata’s skin appears especially clear and bright.
‘Tonight, Ananda, in the last watch, in the ^i[sāl]-grove of the Mallas near Kusinārā, between two ^i[sāl]-trees, the Tathāgata’s final passing will take place. 
And now, Ananda, let us go to the River Kakutthā.’ 
‘Very good, Lord’, said Ānanda.^f164
Two golden robes were 
Pukkusa’s offering: 
Brighter shone the 
Teacher’s body than its dress.

^n196 Then the Lord went with a large number of monks to the River Kakutthā. He entered the water, bathed and drank and, emerging, went to the mango grove, 
where he said to the Venerable Cundaka:
 ‘Come, Cundaka, fold a robe in four for me. I am tired and want to lie down.’ 
‘Very good, Lord’, said Cundaka, and did so.
Then the Lord adopted the lion-posture, lying on his right side, placing one foot on the other, mindfully and with clear awareness bearing in mind the time of awakening. 
And the Venerable Cundaka sat down in front of the Lord.
The Buddha having gone to Kakutthā the river 
With its clear, bright and pleasant waters, 
Therein the Teacher plunged his weary body. 
Tathāgata - without an equal in the world. 
Surrounded by the monks whose head he was. 
The Teacher and Lord, 
Preserver of Dhamma, 
To the Mango Grove the great Sage went, 
And to Cundaka the monk he said: 
‘On a fourfold robe I’ll lie down.’ 
And thus adjured by the great 
Adept, Cundaka placed the fourfold robe. 
The Teacher laid his weary limbs to rest 
While Cundaka kept watch beside him.
^n197 Then the Lord said to the Venerable Ananda: 
‘It might happen, Ananda, that Cunda the smith should feel remorse, thinking: 
“It is your fault, friend Cunda, it is by your misdeed that the Tathāgata gained final Nibbāna after taking his last meal from you!” 
But Cunda’s remorse should be expelled in this way: 
“That is your merit, Cunda, that is your good deed, 
that the Tathāgata gained final Nibbāna after taking his last meal from you! 
For, friend Cunda, I have heard and understood from the Lord’s own lips that these two alms-
givings are of very great fruit, of very great result, more fruitful and advantageous than any other. 
Which two? 
The one is the alms-giving after eating which the Tathāgata attains supreme enlightenment, the other that after which he attains the Nibbana-element without remainder at his final passing. 
These two alms-givings are more fruitful and profitable than all others. 
Cunda’s deed is conducive to long life, to good looks, to happiness, to fame, to heaven and to lordship.” 
In this way, Ananda, Cunda’s remorse is to be expelled.’
Then the Lord, having settled this matter, at that time uttered this verse: 
‘By giving, merit grows, by restraint, hatred’s checked. 
He who’s skilled abandons evil things. 
As greed, hate and folly wane, Nibbāna’s gained.’
^i[End of the fourth recitation-section, concerning Āḷāra] 

^n198 The Lord said:
 ‘Ānanda, let us cross the Hiraññavatī River and go to the Mallas’ ^i[sāl]-grove in the vicinity of Kusinārā. ’^f165 
‘Very good, Lord’, said Ananda, 
and the Lord, with a large company of monks, crossed the river and went to the ^i[sāl]-grove. There the Lord said: 
‘Ananda, prepare me a bed between these twin ^i[sāl]-trees with my head to the north. I am tired and want to lie down.’ 
‘Very good, Lord’, said Ananda, and did so. 
Then the Lord lay down on his right side in the lion-posture, placing one foot on the other, mindful and clearly aware.
And those twin ^i[sāl]-trees burst forth into an abundance of untimely blossoms, 
which fell upon the Tathāgata’s body, sprinkling it and covering it in homage. 
Divine coral-tree flowers fell from the sky, 
divine sandal-wood powder fell from the sky, sprinkling and covering the Tathāgata’s body in homage. 
Divine music 
and song sounded from the sky in homage to the Tathāgata.
^n199 And the Lord said: 
‘Ananda, these ^i[sāl]-trees have burst forth into an abundance of untimely blossoms ... 




Divine music and song sound from the sky in homage to the Tathāgata. 
Never before has the Tathāgata been so honoured, revered, esteemed, worshipped and adored. 
And yet, Ananda, whatever monk, nun, male or female lay-follower dwells practising the Dhamma properly, and perfectly fulfils the Dhamma-way, he or she honours the Tathāgata, reveres and esteems him and pays him the supreme homage. 
Therefore, Ananda, “We will dwell practising the Dhamma properly and perfectly fulfil the Dhamma-way” - this must be your watchword.’

^n200 Just then the Venerable Upavāna was standing in front of the Lord, fanning him. 
And the Lord told him to move: 
‘Move aside, monk, do not stand in front of me.’ 
And the Venerable Ananda thought: 
‘This Venerable Upavāṇa has for long been the Lord’s attendant, keeping close at hand, at his beck and call. 
And now in his last hour the Lord tells him 
to stand aside and not stand in front of him. Why ever does he do that?’
And he asked the Lord about this. 







‘Ānanda, the devas from ten world-spheres have gathered to see the Tathagata. 
For a distance of twelve yojanas around the Mallas’ ^i[sāl]-grove near Kusinara there is not a space you could touch with the point of a hair that is not filled with mighty devas, 
and they are grumbling: 
“We have come a long way to see the Tathāgata. 
It is rare for a Tathagata, a fully-enlightened Buddha, to arise in the world, 
and tonight in the last watch the Tathāgata will attain final Nibbana, 
and this mighty monk is standing in front of the Lord, preventing us from getting a last glimpse of the Tathāgata!”’
^n201 ‘But, Lord, what kind of devas can the Lord perceive?’ 
‘Ananda, there are sky-devas whose minds are earth-bound, they are weeping and tearing their hair, raising their arms, throwing themselves down and twisting and turning, crying: 
“All too soon the Blessed Lord is passing away, all too soon the Well-Farer is passing away, all too soon the Eye of the World is disappearing!” 

And there are earth-devas whose minds are earth-bound, who do likewise. 
But those devas who are free from craving endure patiently, saying: 
“All compounded things are impermanent — what is the use of this?”^f166
^n202 ‘Lord, formerly monks who had spent the Rains in various places used to come to see the Tathagata, 
and we used to welcome them so that such well-trained monks might see you and pay their respects. 
But with the Lord’s passing, we shall no longer have a chance to do this.’
‘Ananda, there are four places the sight of which should arouse emotion^f167 in the faithful. 
Which are they? 
“Here the Tathāgata was born” is the first.^f168
 “Here the Tathagata attained supreme enlightenment” is the second.^f169
 “Here the Tathāgata set in motion the Wheel of Dhamma” is the third.^f170
 “Here the Tathagata attained the Nibbāna-element without remainder” is the fourth.^f171

 And, Ananda, the faithful monks and nuns, male and female lay-followers will visit those places. 

And any who die while making the pilgrimage to these shrines with a devout heart will, at the breaking-up of the body after death, be reborn in a heavenly world.
^n203 ‘Lord, how should we act towards women?’
 ‘Do not see them, Ananda.’ 
‘But if we see them, how should we behave, Lord?’ 
‘Do not speak to them, Ānanda.’ 
‘But if they speak to us, Lord, how should we behave?’ 
‘Practise mindfulness, Ānanda.’^f172
^n204 ‘Lord, what shall we do with the Tathāgata’s remains?’ 
‘Do not worry yourselves about the funeral arrangements, 
Ananda. You should strive for the highest goal,^f173 devote yourselves to the highest goal, and dwell with your minds tirelessly, zealously devoted to the highest goal. 
There are wise Khattiyas, Brahmins and householders who are devoted to the Tathāgata: they will take care of the funeral.’
^n205 ‘But, Lord, what are we to do with the Tathāgata’s remains?’
 ‘Ananda, they should be dealt with like the remains of a wheel-turning monarch.’ 
‘And how is that, Lord?’ 
‘Ānanda, the remains of a wheel-turning monarch are wrapped in a new linen-cloth. 
This they wrap in teased cotton wool, and this in a new cloth. 
Having done this five hundred times each, they enclose the king’s body in an oil-vat of iron,^f174 which is covered with another iron pot. 
Then having made a funeral-pyre of all manner of perfumes they cremate the king’s body, and they raise a stupa at a crossroads. 
That, Ananda, is what they do with the remains of a wheel-turning monarch, and they should deal with the Tathāgata’s body in the same way. 
A stupa should be erected at the crossroads for the Tathāgata. 
And whoever lays wreaths or puts sweet perfumes and colours^f175 there with a devout heart, will reap benefit and happiness for a long time.
^n206 ‘Ananda, there are four persons worthy of a stupa. 
Who are they? 
A Tathāgata, Arahant, fully-enlightened Buddha is one, a Pacceka Buddha^f176 is one, a disciple of the Tathagata is one, and a wheel-turning monarch is one. 
And why is each of these worthy of a stupa? 
Because, Ananda, at the thought: “This is the stupa of a Tathāgata, of a Pacceka Buddha, of a disciple of the Tathāgata, of a wheel-turning monarch”
, people’s hearts are made peaceful, and then, at the breaking-up of the body after death they go to a good destiny and rearise in a heavenly world. 
That is the reason, and those are the four who are worthy of a stupa.’













^n207 And the Venerable Ananda went into his lodging^f177 and stood lamenting, leaning on the door-post:^f178
 ‘Alas, I am still a learner with much to do! And the Teacher is passing away, who was so compassionate to me!’
Then the Lord enquired of the monks 
where Ananda was, 
and they told him. 

So he said to a certain monk: 
‘Go, monk, and say to Ananda from me: 


“Friend Ananda, the Teacher summons you.”’ 
‘Very good, Lord’, said the monk, and did so. ‘Very good, friend’, Ananda replied to that monk, and he went to the Lord, saluted him and sat down to one side.And the Lord said: 
‘Enough, Ananda, do not weep and wail! Have I not already told you that 
all things that are pleasant and delightful are changeable, subject to separation and becoming other? 
So how could it be, Ānanda - since whatever is born, become, compounded is subject to decay — how could it be that it should not pass away? 
For a long time, Ananda, you have been in the Tathagata’s presence, showing loving-kindness in act of body, speech and mind, beneficially, blessedly, whole-heartedly and unstintingly. 
You have achieved much merit, Ananda. Make the effort, and in a short time you will be free of the corruptions.’^f179
^n208 Then the Lord addressed the monks: 
‘Monks, all those who were Arahant fully-enlightened Buddhas in the past have had just such a chief attendant as Ananda, 
and so too will those Blessed Lords who come in the future. 
Monks, Ananda is wise. 

He knows when it is the right time for monks to come to see the Tathagata, when it is the right time for nuns, for male lay-followers, for female lay-followers, for kings, for royal ministers, for leaders of other schools, and for their pupils.
^n209 ‘Ānanda has four remarkable and wonderful qualities. 
What are they? 
If a company of monks comes to see Ananda, 
they are pleased at the sight of him, 
and when Ananda talks Dhamma to them they are pleased, and when he is silent they are disappointed. 
And so it is, too, with nuns, 


with male 


and female lay-followers.^f180





 And these four qualities apply to a wheel-turning monarch: 


if he is visited by a company of Khattiyas, of Brahmins, 
of householders, 
or of ascetics, they are pleased at the sight of him 
and when he talks to them, 
and when he is silent they are disappointed. 
And so too it is with Ananda.’











^n210 After this the Venerable Ananda said: 
‘Lord, may the Blessed Lord not pass away in this miserable little town of wattle-and-daub, right in the jungle in the back of beyond! 
Lord, there are other great cities such as 
Campa, Rajagaha, Savatthi, Saketa, Kosambi or Varanasi. 

In those places there are wealthy Khattiyas, Brahmins and householders who are devoted to the Tathagata, 
and they will provide for the Tathagata’s funeral in proper style.’
‘Ananda, don’t call it 
a miserable little town of wattle-and-daub, right in the jungle in the back of beyond!
‘Once upon a time, Ananda, King Mahasudassana was a wheel-turning monarch, a rightful and righteous king, who had conquered the land in four directions and ensured the security of his realm, and who possessed the seven treasures. 
And, Ananda, this King Mahasudassana had this very Kusinara, under the name of Kusāvatī, for his capital. 
And it was twelve yojanas long from east to west, and seven yojanas wide from north to south. 
Kusāvatī was rich, prosperous and well-populated, crowded with people and well-stocked with food. 
Just as the deva-city of Ālakamandā^f181 is rich, prosperous and well-populated, crowded with yakkhas and well-stocked with food, 
so was the royal city of Kusāvatī. 
And the city of Kusāvatī was never free of ten sounds by day or night: 
the sound of elephants, horses, carriages, kettle-drums, side-drums, lutes, singing, cymbals and gongs, with cries of “Eat, drink and be merry!” as tenth.^f182
‘And now, Ananda, go to Kusinara and announce to the Mallas of Kusinara: 
“Tonight, Vasetthas,^f183 in the last watch, the Tathagata will attain final Nibbana. 
Approach him, Vasetthas, approach him, 
lest later you should regret it, saying: 
‘The Tathagata passed away in our parish, and we did not take the opportunity to see him for the last time!’”’ 
‘Very good, Lord’, said Ananda and, taking robe and bowl, he went with a companion to Kusinara.
^n211 Just then the Mallas of Kusinārā were assembled in their meeting-hall on some business. 
And Ananda came to them and delivered the Lord’s words. 




And when they heard Ānanda’s words, the Mallas, with their sons, daughters-in-law and wives were struck with anguish and sorrow, their minds were overcome with grief so that they were all weeping and tearing their hair...

Then they all went to the ^i[sāl]-grove where the Venerable Ananda was.
And Ananda thought: 
‘If I allow the Mallas of Kusinārā to salute the Lord individually, the night will have passed before they have all paid homage. 
I had better let them pay homage family by family, saying: 
“Lord, the Malla so-and-so with his children, his wife, his servants and his friends pays homage at the Lord’s feet.”’ 


And so he presented them in that way, and thus allowed all the Mallas of Kusinārā to pay homage to the Lord in the first watch.
^n212 And at that time a wanderer called Subhadda was in Kusinārā, and he heard that the ascetic Gotama was to attain final Nibbāna in the final watch of that night. 
He thought: 


‘I have heard from venerable wanderers, advanced in years, teachers of teachers, 
that a Tathāgata, a fully-enlightened Buddha, only rarely arises in the world. 
And tonight in the last watch the ascetic Gotama will attain final Nibbāna. 
Now a doubt has arisen in my mind, 
and I feel sure that the ascetic Gotama can teach me a doctrine to dispel that doubt.’
So Subhadda went to the Mallas’ ^i[sāl]-grove, to where the Venerable Ananda was, and told him what he had thought: 
‘Reverend Ananda, may I be permitted to see the ascetic Gotama? ’ 





But Ananda replied: 
‘Enough, friend Subhadda, do not disturb the Tathāgata, the Lord is weary.’ 
And Subhadda made his request a second 
and a third time, but still Ananda refused it.








^n213 But the Lord overheard this conversation between Ānanda and Subhadda, 
and he called to Ananda: 
‘Enough, Ananda, do not hinder Subhadda, let him see the Tathāgata. 
For whatever Subhadda asks me he will ask in quest of enlightenment^f184 and not to annoy me, 
and what I say in reply to his questions he will quickly understand.’ 
Then Ananda said: 
‘Go in, friend Subhadda, the Lord gives you leave.’
Then Subhadda approached the Lord, exchanged courtesies with him, and sat down to one side, saying: 
‘Venerable Gotama, all those ascetics and Brahmins who have orders and followings, who are teachers, well-known and famous as founders of schools, and popularly regarded as saints,
 like Pūraṇa Kassapa, Makkhali Gosāla, Ajita Kesakambali, Pakudha Kaccāyana, Sañjaya Belatthaputta and the Nigantha Nātaputta - 
have they all realised the truth as they all make out, or have none of them realised it, or have some realised it and some not?’ 
‘Enough, Subhadda, never mind whether all, or none, 
or some of them have realised the truth. 
I will teach you Dhamma, Subhadda. 
Listen, pay close attention, and I will speak.’ 
‘Yes, Lord’, said Subhadda, 
and the Lord said:
^n214 ‘In whatever Dhamma and discipline the Noble Eightfold Path is not found, no ascetic is found of the first, the second, the third or the fourth grade.^f185
 But such ascetics can be found, of the first, second, third and fourth grade in a Dhamma and discipline where the Noble Eightfold Path is found. 
Now, Subhadda, in this Dhamma and discipline the Noble Eightfold Path is found, and in it are to be found ascetics of the first, second, third and fourth grade. 
Those other schools are devoid of 〔true〕 ascetics; but if in this one the monks were to live the life to perfection, the world would not lack for Arahants.
Twenty-nine years of age I was 
When I went forth to seek the Good. 
Now over fifty years have passed 
Since the day that I went forth 
To roam the realm of wisdom’s law 
Outside of which no ascetic is 
〔First, second, 
third or
 fourth degree〕. 
Other schools of such are bare, 
But if here monks live perfectly, The world won’t lack for Arahants.^f186
^n215 At this the wanderer Subhadda said: 
‘Excellent, Lord, excellent! 
It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there. Just so the Blessed Lord has expounded the Dhamma in various ways. 
And I, Lord, go for refuge to the Blessed Lord, the Dhamma and the Sangha. 
May I receive the going-forth in the Lord’s presence! May I receive ordination!’
‘Subhadda, whoever, coming from another school, seeks the going-forth and ordination in this Dhamma and discipline, must wait four months on probation. And at the end of four months, those monks who are established in mind^f187 may let him go forth and give him ordination to the status of a monk. 
However, there can be a distinction of persons.’ 
‘Lord, if those coming from other schools must wait four months on probation,... I will wait four years, and then let them give me the going-forth and the ordination!’ 
But the Lord said to Ananda: 
‘Let Subhadda go forth!’ 
‘Very good, Lord’, said Ananda.
And Subhadda said to the Venerable Ānanda: 
‘Friend Ānanda, it is a great gain for you all, it is very profitable for you, 
that you have obtained the consecration of discipleship in the Teacher’s presence.’ 
Then Subhadda received the going-forth in the Lord’s presence, and the ordination. 
And from the moment of his ordination the Venerable Subhadda, alone, secluded, unwearying, zealous and resolute, in a short time attained to that for which young men of good family go forth from the household life into homelessness, that unexcelled culmination of the holy life, having realised it here and now by his own insight, and dwelt therein: 
‘Birth is destroyed, the holy life has been lived, what had to be done has been done, there is nothing further here.’ 
And the Venerable Subhadda became another of the Arahants. 
He was the last personal disciple of the Lord.^f188
 ^i[End of the fifth recitation-section] (^i[Hiraññavatī])〕 
^n216 And the Lord said to Ananda: 
‘Ananda, it may be that you will think: 
“The Teacher’s instruction has ceased, now we have no teacher!” 
It should not be seen like this, 
Ananda, for what I have taught and explained to you as Dhamma and discipline will, at my passing, be your teacher.
‘And whereas the monks are in the habit of addressing one another as “friend”, this custom is to be abrogated after my passing. 
Senior monks shall address more junior monks by their name, their clan or as “friend”,^f189 
whereas more junior monks are to address their seniors either as “Lord”^f190 or as “Venerable Sir”.^f191
‘If they wish, the order may abolish the minor rules after my passing.^f192 
‘After my passing, the monk Channa is to receive the Brahma-penalty.’^f193
 ‘But, Lord, what is the Brahma-penalty?’ 
‘Whatever the monk Channa wants or says, 
he is not to be spoken to, admonished or instructed by the monks.’
^n217 Then the Lord addressed the monks, saying: 
‘It may be, monks, that some monk has doubts or uncertainty about the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Sangha, or about the path or the practice. Ask, monks! Do not afterwards feel remorse, thinking: 
“The Teacher was there before us, and we failed to ask the Lord face to face!”
’ At these words the monks were silent. 
The Lord repeated his words a second 
and a third time, 


and still the monks were silent. 
Then the Lord said: 
‘Perhaps, monks, you do not ask out of respect for the Teacher. Then, monks, let one friend tell it to another.’ 
But still they were silent.
And the Venerable Ananda said: 
‘It is wonderful, Lord, it is marvellous! I clearly perceive that in this assembly there is not one monk who has doubts or uncertainty...’ 
‘You, Ananda, speak from faith.^f194 But the Tathāgata knows that in this assembly there is not one monk who has doubts or uncertainty about the Buddha, the Dhamma or the Sangha or about the path or the practice. 
Ānanda, the least one of these five hundred monks is a Stream-Winner, incapable of falling into states of woe, certain of Nibbāna.’
^n218 Then the Lord said to the monks: 
‘Now, monks, I declare to you: 
all conditioned things are of a nature to decay — strive on untiringly.’^f195
 These were the Tathāgata’s last words.
^n219 Then the Lord entered the first jhāna. And leaving that he entered the second, the third, the fourth jhāna. Then leaving the fourth jhāna he entered the Sphere of Infinite Space, then the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness, then the Sphere of No-Thingness, then the Sphere of Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception, and leaving that he attained the Cessation of Feeling and Perception.^f196 
Then the Venerable Ananda said to the Venerable Anuruddha: 
‘Venerable Anuruddha, the Lord has passed away.’ 
‘No, friend Ānanda,^f197 the Lord has not passed away, he has attained the Cessation of Feeling and Perception.’
Then the Lord, leaving the attainment of the Cessation of Feeling and Perception, entered the Sphere of Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception, from that he entered the Sphere of No-Thingness, the Sphere of Infinite Consciousness, the Sphere of Infinite Space. From the Sphere of Infinite Space he entered the fourth jhāna, from there the third, the second and the first jhāna. Leaving the first jhāna, he entered the second, the third, the fourth jhāna. And, leaving the fourth jhāna, the Lord finally passed away. 
^n220 And at the Blessed Lord’s final passing there was a great earthquake, terrible and hair-raising, accompanied by thunder. 
And Brahmā Sahampati^f198 uttered this verse:
‘All beings in the world, 
all bodies must break up: 
Even the Teacher, 
peerless in the human world, 
The mighty Lord and perfect 
Buddha’s passed away.’
^n221  And Sakka, ruler of the devas, uttered this verse:
‘Impermanent are compounded things,
 prone to rise and fall, 
Having risen, they’re destroyed, 
their passing truest bliss.’^f199
^n222  And the Venerable Anuruddha uttered this verse:
‘No breathing in and out - 
just with steadfast heart 
The Sage who’s free from l
ust has passed away to peace.
With mind unshaken 
he endured all pains:
By Nibbāna 
the Illumined’s mind is freed.’
^n223  And the Venerable Ananda uttered this verse:
‘Terrible was the quaking, 
men’s hair stood on end, 
When the all-accomplished 
Buddha passed away.’
^n224 And those monks who had not yet overcome their passions wept and tore their hair, raising their arms, throwing themselves down and twisting and turning, crying: ‘All too soon the Blessed Lord has passed away, all too soon the Well-Farer has passed away, all too soon the Eye of the World has disappeared!’ 
But those monks who were free from craving endured mindfully and clearly aware, saying: 
‘All compounded things are impermanent — what is the use of this?’
^n225 Then the Venerable Anuruddha said: 
‘Friends, enough of your weeping and wailing! 
Has not the Lord already told you that 
all things that are pleasant and delightful are changeable, subject to separation and to becoming other? So why all this, friends? 
Whatever is born, become, compounded is subject to decay, it cannot be that it does not decay. 
The devas, friends, are grumbling.’
‘Venerable Anuruddha, what kind of devas are you aware of?’ 
‘Friend Ānanda, there are sky-devas whose minds are earth-bound they are weeping and tearing their hair...


And there are earth-devas whose minds are earth-bound, they do likewise. 
But those devas who are free from craving endure patiently, saying: 
“All compounded things are impermanent. What is the use of this?”’
Then the Venerable Anuruddha and the Venerable Ānanda spent the rest of the night in conversation on Dhamma.
^n226  And the Venerable Anuruddha said: 
‘Now go, friend Ananda, to Kusinara and announce to the Mallas: 
“Vasetthas, the Lord has passed away. 
Now is the time to do as you think fit.” 
“Yes, Lord”, said Ananda, and having dressed in the morning and taken his robe and bowl, he went with a companion to Kusinara. 
At that time the Mallas of Kusinara were assembled in their meeting-hall on some business. 
And the Venerable Ānanda came to them and delivered the Venerable Anuruddha’s message. 


And when they heard the Venerable Ānanda’s words, the Mallas ... 
were struck with anguish and sorrow, their minds were overcome with grief so that they were all tearing their hair...
^n227 Then the Mallas ordered their men 
to bring perfume and wreaths, and gather all the musicians together. 
And with the perfumes and wreaths, and all the musicians, and with five hundred sets of garments they went to the ^i[sāl]-grove where the Lord’s body was lying. And there they honoured, paid respects, worshipped and adored the Lord’s body with dance and song and music, with garlands and scents, making awnings and circular tents in order to spend the day there. 
And they thought: 
‘It is too late to cremate the Lord’s body today. We shall do so tomorrow.’ 
And so, paying homage in the same way, they waited for a second, a third, a fourth, a fifth, a sixth day.
And on the seventh day the Mallas of Kusinara thought: 
‘We have paid sufficient honour with song and dance... to the Lord’s body, now we shall burn his body after carrying him out by the south gate.’ 
^n228 Then eight Malla chiefs, having washed their heads and put on new clothes, declared: 
‘Now we will lift up the Lord’s body’, but found they were unable to do so. 
So they went to the Venerable Anuruddha and told him what had happened: 
‘Why can’t we lift up the Lord’s body?’ 

‘Vasetthas, your intention is one thing, but the intention of the devas is another.’
‘Lord, what is the intention of the devas?’
 
‘Vasetthas, your intention is, having paid homage to the Lord’s body with dance and song..., to burn his body after carrying him out by the south gate. 
But the devas’ intention is, 
having paid homage to the Lord’s body with heavenly dance and song..., to carry him to the north of the city, bring him in through the north gate and bear him through the middle of the city and out through the eastern gate to the Mallas’ shrine of Makuta-Bandhana, and there to burn the body.’ 
‘Lord, if that is the devas’ intention, so be it!’
^n229 At that time even the sewers and rubbish-heaps of Kusinara were covered knee-high with coral-tree flowers. And the devas as well as the Mallas of Kusinara honoured the Lord’s body with divine and human dancing, song...; 
and they carried the body to the north of the city, brought it in through the north gate, through the middle of the city and out through the eastern gate to the Mallas’ shrine of Makuta-here they set the body down.
^n230 Then they asked the Venerable Ananda: 
‘Lord, how should we deal with the body of the Tathāgata?’ 
‘Vāseṭṭhas, you should deal with the Tathāgata’s body as you would that of a wheel-turning monarch.’ 
‘And how do they deal with that, Lord?’
‘Vaseṭṭhas, the remains are wrapped in a new linen-cloth. 
This they wrap in teased cotton-wool...; then having made a funeral-pyre of all manner of perfumes, they cremate the king’s body and they raise a stupa at a cross roads...’





Then the Mallas ordered their men 
to bring their teased cotton-wool. 
And they dealt with the Tathāgata’s body accordingly... 

^n231 Now just then the Venerable Kassapa the Great^f200 was travelling along the main road from Pāvā to Kusinārā with a large company of about five hundred monks. 
And leaving the road, the Venerable Kassapa the Great sat down under a tree. 
And a certain Ājīvika^f201 chanced to be coming along the main road towards Pāvā, and he had picked a coral-tree flower in Kusinārā. 
The Venerable Kassapa saw him coming from afar, and said to him: 
‘Friend, do you know our Teacher?’ 
‘Yes, friend, I do. The ascetic Gotama passed away a week ago. 
I picked this coral-tree flower there.’ 
And those monks who had not yet overcome their passions wept and tore their hair... 

But those monks who were free from craving endured mindfully and clearly aware, saying: 
‘All compounded things are impermanent - what is the use of this?’
^n232 And sitting in the group was one Subhadda,^f202 who had gone forth late in life, 
and he said to those monks: 
‘Enough, friends, do not weep and wail! We are well rid of the Great Ascetic. We were always bothered by his saying: 
“It is fitting for you to do this, it is not fitting for you to do that!” 
Now we can do what we like, and not do what we don’t like!’
But the Venerable Kassapa the Great said to the monks: 
‘Friends, enough of your weeping and wailing! 
Has not the Lord already told you that all things that are pleasant and delightful are changeable, subject to separation and becoming other? 
So why all this, friends? 
Whatever is born, become, compounded is subject to decay, it cannot be that it does not decay.’
^n233 Meanwhile four Malla chiefs, having washed their heads and put on new clothes, said: 
‘We will light the Lord’s funeral pyre’, but they were unable to do so. 
They went to the Venerable Anuruddha and asked him why this was. 
‘Vāseṭṭhas, your intention is one thing, but that of the devas is another.’ 
‘Well, Lord, what is the intention of the devas?’ 
‘Vāseṭṭhas, the devas’ intention is this: 


“The Venerable Kassapa the Great is coming along the main road from Pāvā to Kusinārā with a large company of five hundred monks. 
The Lord’s funeral pyre will not be lit until the Venerable Kassapa the Great has paid homage with his head to the Lord’s feet.’ 
‘Lord, if that is the devas’ intention, so be it!’
^n234 Then the Venerable Kassapa the Great went to the Mallas’ shrine at Makuta-Bandhana to the Lord’s funeral pyre and, covering one shoulder with his robe, joined his hands in salutation, circumambulated the pyre three times and, uncovering the Lord’s feet, paid homage with his head to them, 
and the five hundred monks did likewise. 
And when this was done, the Lord’s funeral pyre ignited of itself.
^n235 And when the Lord’s body was burnt, what had been skin, under-skin, flesh, sinew, or joint-fluid, all that vanished and not even ashes or dust remained, 
only the bones^f203 remained. 
Just as when butter or oil is burnt, no ashes or dust remain, so it was with the Lord’s body...

, only the bones were left. 
And all the five hundred garments, even the innermost and the outermost cloth, were burnt up. 
And when the Lord’s body was burnt up, a shower of water from the sky, 
and another which burst forth from the ^i[sāl]-trees^f204 extinguished the funeral pyre. 
And the Mallas of Kusinārā poured perfumed water over it for the same purpose. 
Then the Mallas honoured the relics for a week in their assembly hall, having made a lattice-work of spears and an encircling wall of bows, with dancing, singing, garlands and music.
^n236 And King Ajātasattu Vedehiputta of Magadha heard that the Lord had passed away at Kusinārā.
And he sent a message to the Mallas of Kusinārā: 
‘The Lord was a Khattiya and I am a Khattiya. 
I am worthy to receive a share of the Lord’s remains. I will make a great stupa for them.’ 
The Licchavis of Vesālī heard, and they sent a message: 


‘The Lord was a Khattiya and we are Khattiyas. We are worthy to receive a share of the Lord’s remains, and we will make a great stupa for them.’ 
The Sakyas of Kapilavatthu heard, and they sent a message: 


‘The Lord was the chief of our clan. We are worthy to receive a share of the Lord’s remains, and we will make a great stupa for them.’ 
‘The Bulayas of Allakappa and the Koliyas of Rāmagāma replied similarly. 
The Brahmin of Vethadipa heard, and he sent a message: 

‘The Lord was a Khattiya, I am a Brahmin...’
, and the Mallas of Pava sent a message: 


‘The Lord was a Khattiya, we are Khattiyas. We are worthy to receive a share of the Lord’s remains, and we will make a great stupa for them.’






On hearing all this, the Mallas of Kusinārā addressed the crowd, saying: 
‘The Lord passed away in our parish. We will not give away any share of the Lord’s remains.’ 
At this the Brahmin Dona addressed the crowd in this verse:
‘Listen, lords, to my proposal. 
^n237 Forbearance is the Buddha’s teaching. 
It is not right that strife should come 
From sharing out the best of men’s remains. 
Let’s all be joined in harmony and peace, 
In friendship sharing out portions eight: 
Let stupas far and wide be put up, 
That all may see — and gain in faith!’
‘Well then, Brahmin, you divide up the remains of the 
Lord in the best and fairest way!’ 
^n238 ‘Very good, friends’, said Dona. 
And he made a good and fair division into eight portions, and then said to the assembly: 
‘Gentlemen, please give me the urn, and I will erect a great stupa for it.’ 
So they gave Dona the urn.
Now the Moriyas of Pipphalavana heard 
of the Lord’s passing, 
and they sent a message: 
‘The Lord was a Khattiya and we are Khattiyas. We are worthy to receive a portion of the Lord’s remains, and we will make a great stupa for them.’
‘There is not a portion of the Lord’s remains left, they have all been divided up. 
So you must take the embers.’ 
And so they took the embers.
^n239 Then King Ajatasattu of Magadha built a great stupa for the Lord’s relics at Rajagaha. 
The Licchavis of Vesālī built one at Vesālī, 
the Sakyans of Kapilavatthu built one at Kapilavatthu, 
the Bulayas of Allakappa built one at Allakappa, 
the Koliyas of Ramagama built one at Ramagama, 
the Brahmin of Vethadipa built one at Vethadipa, 
the Mallas of Pava built one at Pava, 
the Mallas of Kusinara built a great stupa for the Lord’s relics at Kusinara, 
the Brahmin Dona built a great stupa for the urn, 
and the Moriyas of Pipphalavana built a great stupa for the embers at Pipphalavana. 
Thus, eight stupas were built for the relics, a ninth for the urn, and a tenth for the embers. 
That is how it was in the old days.^f205
^n240 Eight portions of relics there were of him, The All-Seeing One. 
Of these, seven remained In Jambudīpa with honour. 
The eighth In Rāmagāma’s kept by naga kings. 
One tooth the Thirty Gods have kept, 
Kalinga’s kings have one, the nagas too. 
They shed their glory o’er the fruitful earth. 
Thus the Seer’s honoured by the honoured. 
Gods and nagas, kings, the noblest men 
Clasp their hands in homage, for hard it is 
To find another such for countless aeons.^f206











^ck#d17(^z1[Mahāsudassana Sutta: The Great Splendour] ^h[A King’s Renunciation] )^n241 THUS HAVE I HEARD.^f207 
Once the Lord was staying at Kusinara in the Mallas’ ^i[sāl]-grove shortly before his final Nibbana between the twin ^i[sāl]-trees.
The Venerable Ananda came to the Lord, saluted him, sat down to one side and said: 
‘Lord, may the Blessed Lord not pass away in this miserable little town of wattle-and-daub, right in the jungle in the back of beyond! 
Lord, there are other great cities such as 
Campa, Rajagaha, Savatthi, Saketa, Kosambi or Vārānāsī. 

In those places there are wealthy Khattiyas, Brahmins and householders who are devoted to the Tathagata and they will provide for the Tathāgata’s funeral in proper style.’
^n242 ‘Ananda, don’t call it 
a miserable little town of wattle-and-daub, right in the jungle in the back of beyond! 
Once upon a time, Ananda, King Mahāsudassana^f208 was a wheel-turning monarch, a rightful and righteous king, 
who had conquered the land in four directions and ensured the security of his realm. 
And it was twelve yojanas long from east to west, and seven yojanas wide from north to south. 
Kusāvatī was rich, prosperous and well-populated, crowded with people and well-stocked with food. 
Just as the deva-city of Āḷakamandā is rich... 
(^i[as Sutta 16], ^i[verse] 5.18), so was the royal city of Kusavati. 
And the city of Kusavati was never free of ten sounds by day or night: 
the sound of elephants, horses, carriages, kettle-drums, side-drums, lutes, singing, cymbals and gongs, with cries of “Eat, drink and be merry” as tenth.
‘The royal city of Kusāvatī was surrounded by seven encircling walls. 
One was of gold, one silver, one beryl, one crystal, one ruby, one emerald, and one of all sorts of gems.
‘And the gates of Kusavati were of four colours: 
one gold, one silver, one beryl, one crystal. 
And before each gate were set seven pillars, three or four times a man’s height. 
One was of gold, one silver, one beryl, one crystal, one ruby, one emerald, and one of all sorts of gems.
‘Kusāvatī was surrounded by seven rows of palm-trees, 
of the same materials. 
The gold trees had gold trunks with silver leaves and fruit, 
the silver trees had silver trunks with gold leaves and fruit. 
The beryl trees had beryl trunks with crystal leaves and fruit, 
the crystal trees had crystal trunks with beryl leaves and fruit. 
The ruby trees had ruby trunks and emerald leaves and fruit, 
the emerald trees had emerald trunks and ruby leaves and fruit, 
while the trees of all sorts of gems were the same as regards trunks, leaves and fruit. 
The sound of the leaves stirred by the wind was lovely, delightful, sweet and intoxicating, 
just like that of the five kinds of musical instruments^f209 played in concert by well-trained and skilful players.
 
And, Ananda, those who were libertines and drunkards in Kusavati had their desires assuaged by the sound of the leaves in the wind.^f210
^n243 ‘King Mahasudassana was endowed with the seven treasures and the four properties. 
What are the seven? 
Once, on a fast-day of the fifteenth,^f211 when the King had washed his head and gone up to the verandah on top of his palace to observe the fast-day, 
the divine Wheel-Treasure^f212 appeared to him, thousand-spoked, complete with felloe, hub and all appurtenances. 
On seeing it, King Mahasudassana thought: 
“I have heard that when a duly anointed Khattiya king sees such a wheel on the fast-day of the fifteenth, he will become a wheel-turning monarch. 
May I become such a monarch!”
^n244 ‘Then, rising from his seat, covering one shoulder with his robe, the King took a gold vessel in his left hand, sprinkled the Wheel with his right hand, and said: 
“May the noble Wheel-Treasure turn, may the noble Wheel-Treasure conquer!” 
The Wheel turned to the east, and King Mahasudassana followed it with his fourfold army.^f213 And in whatever country the Wheel stopped, the King took up residence with his fourfold army.
‘And those kings who faced him in the eastern region came and said: 
“Come, Your Majesty, welcome! We are yours, Your Majesty. Rule us, Your Majesty!” 
And the King said: 
“Do not take life. Do not take what is not given. Do not commit sexual misconduct. Do not tell lies. Do not drink strong drink. Be moderate in eating.”^f214
 And those who had faced him in the eastern region became his subjects.
‘And when the Wheel had plunged into the eastern sea, it emerged and turned south, and King Mahasudassana followed it with his fourfold army. And those Kings ... become his subjects. 
Having plunged into the southern sea it turned west...
, having plunged into the western sea it turned north, and King Mahasudassana followed it with his fourfold army ... 
and those who had faced him in the northern region became his subjects.





^n245 ‘Then the Wheel-Treasure, having conquered the lands from sea to sea, returned to the royal capital of Kusāvati and stopped before the King’s palace as he was trying a case,^f215 as if to adorn the royal palace. 
And this is how the Wheel-Treasure appeared to King Mahasudassana.
^n246 ‘Then the Elephant-Treasure appeared to King Mahāsudassana, 
pure white,^f216 of sevenfold strength, with the wonderful power of travelling through the air, a royal tusker called Uposatha.^f217
 Seeing him, the King thought: 
“What a wonderful riding-elephant, if only he could be brought under control!” 
And this Elephant-Treasure submitted to control just like a thoroughbred that had been trained for a long time. 
And once the King, to try him, mounted the Elephant-Treasure at crack of dawn and rode him from sea to sea, returning to Kusāvatī in time for breakfast. 
And that is how the Elephant-Treasure appeared to King Mahasudassana.
^n247 ‘Then the Horse-Treasure appeared to King Mahasudassana, 
with a crow’s head,^f218 dark-maned, with the wondrous power of travelling through the air, a royal stallion called Valahaka.^f219
 And the King thought: 
“What a wonderful mount, if only he could be brought under control!” 
And this Horse-Treasure submitted to control just like a thoroughbred that had been trained for a long time... 

And that is how the Horse-Treasure appeared to King Mahasudassana.
^n248 ‘Then the Jewel-Treasure appeared to King Mahāsudassana. 
It was a beryl, pure, excellent, well-cut into eight facets, clear, bright, unflawed, perfect in every respect. 
The lustre of this Jewel-Treasure radiated for an entire yojana round about. 
And once the King, to try it, went on night-manoeuvres on a dark night with his four-fold army, with the Jewel-Treasure fixed to the top of his standard. 
And all who lived in the villages round about started their daily work, thinking it was daylight. 
And that is how the Jewel-Treasure appeared to King Mahāsudassana.
^n249 ‘Then the Woman-Treasure appeared to King Mahāsudassana, 
lovely, fair to see, charming, with a lotus-like complexion, not too tall or too short, not too thin or too fat, not too dark or too fair, of more than human, deva-like beauty. 
And the touch of the skin of the Woman-Treasure was like cotton or silk, 
and her limbs were cool when it was hot, and warm when it was cold. 
Her body smelt of sandal-wood and her lips of lotus. 
This Woman-Treasure rose before the King and retired later, and was always willing to do his pleasure, and she was pleasant of speech. 
And this Woman-Treasure was not unfaithful to the King even in thought, much less in deed. 
And that is how the Woman-Treasure appeared to King Mahasudassana. ^f220
^n250 ‘Then the Householder-Treasure appeared to King Mahasudassana. 
With the divine eye which, as the result of kamma, he possessed,^f221 he saw where treasure, owned and ownerless, was hidden. 
He came to the King and said: 
“Have no fear, Your Majesty, I will look after your wealth properly.” 
And once, the King, to try him, went on board a ship and had it taken to the current in the middle of the Ganges. Then he said to the Householder-Treasure: 
“Householder, I want some gold coin!” 
“Well then, Sire, let the ship be brought to one bank.” 
“I want the gold coins here!” 
Then the householder touched the water with both hands and drew out a vessel full of gold coins, saying: 
“Is that enough, Sire? Will that do, Sire?” 
and the King said: 
“That is enough, householder, that will do, you have served me enough.” 
And that is how the Householder-Treasurer appeared to King Mahāsudassana.
^n251 ‘Again, Ananda, King Mahasudassana was endowed with the four properties.^f222
 What are they? 
Firstly, the King was handsome, good to look at, pleasing, with a complexion like the finest lotus, surpassing other men.



^n252 



‘Secondly, he was long-lived, outliving other men.

‘Thirdly, he was free from illness, free from sickness, with a healthy digestion, less subject to cold and heat than that of other men.^f223

‘Fourthly, he was beloved and popular with Brahmins and householders. 
Just as a father is beloved by his children, so he was with Brahmins and householders. 

And they were beloved by the King 
as children are beloved by their father. 

Once the King set out for the pleasure-park with his fourfold army, 
and the Brahmins and householders came to him and said: 
“Pass slowly by, Sire, that we may see you as long as possible!” 
And the King said to the charioteer: 
“Drive the chariot slowly so that I can see these Brahmins and householders as long as possible.” 

Thus King Mahasudassana was endowed with these four properties.
^n253 ‘Then King Mahasudassana thought: 
“Suppose I were to construct lotus-ponds between the palm-trees, a hundred bow-lengths^f224 apart.” 
And he did so. 
The lotus-ponds were lined with four-coloured tiles, 
gold, silver, beryl and crystal, 
each pond being approached by four staircases, 
one gold, one silver, one beryl and one crystal. 
And the gold staircase had gold posts with silver railings and banisters,
 the silver had silver posts with gold railings and banisters, and so on. 


And the lotus-ponds were provided with two kinds of parapet, gold and silver — 
the gold parapets having gold posts, silver railings and banisters, 
and the silver parapets having silver posts, gold railings and banisters.
‘Then the King thought: 
“Suppose I were to provide each pond with suitable 〔flowers for〕 garlands^f225 - blue, yellow, red and white lotuses which will last through all seasons without fading?” 
And he did so. 
^n254 Then he thought: 
“Suppose I were to place bathmen on the banks of these ponds, to bathe those who come there?” 
And he did so. 
Then he thought: 
“Suppose I were to establish charitable posts on the banks of these ponds, 
so that those who want food can get it, those who want drink can get it, those who want clothes can get it, those who want transport can get it, those who want a sleeping-place can get it, those who want a wife can get one, and those who want gold coin can get it?” 
And he did so.

^n255 ‘Then the Brahmins and householders took great wealth and went to the King, saying: 
“Sire, here is wealth that we have gathered together especially for Your Majesty, please accept it!” 
“Thank you, friends, but I have enough wealth from legitimate revenues. Let this be yours, and take away more besides!” 
Being thus refused by the King, they withdrew to one side and considered: 
“It would not be right for us to take this wealth back home again. 
Suppose we were to build a dwelling for King Mahasudassana.” 
So they went to the King and said: 
“Sire, we would build you a dwelling”, 
and the King accepted by silence.
^n256 ‘Then Sakka, ruler of the gods, knowing in his mind King Mahasudassana’s thought, said to the attendant-deva Vissakamma: ^f226
 “Come, friend Vissakamma, and build a dwelling for King Mahasudassana, a palace called Dhamma.” 
“Very good, Lord”, Vissakamma replied and, as swiftly as a strong man might stretch his flexed arm or flex it again, he at once vanished from the Heaven of the Thirty-Three and appeared before King Mahasudassana, 
and said to him: 
“Sire, I shall build you a dwelling, a palace called Dhamma.” 
The King assented by silence, 
and Vissakamma built him the Palace of Dhamma.
‘The Palace of Dhamma, Ananda, was a yojana in length from east to west, and half a yojana wide from north to south. 
The whole palace was faced up to three times a man’s height with tiles of four colours, 
gold, silver, beryl and crystal, 
and it contained eighty-four thousand columns of 
the same four colours. 


It had twenty-four staircases of the same four colours, 
and the gold staircases had gold posts with silver railings and banisters... 
(^i[as verse 23]). 



It also had eighty-four thousand chambers of the same colours. 

In the gold chamber was a silver couch, in the silver chamber a gold couch, in the beryl chamber an ivory couch, and in the crystal chamber a sandalwood couch. 
On the door of the gold chamber a silver palm-tree was figured, with silver stem, gold leaves and fruit... 
On the door of the silver chamber a golden palm-tree was figured, with golden trunk, leaves and fruit, 
on the door of the beryl chamber a crystal palm-tree was figured, with crystal trunk and beryl leaves and fruit, 
on the door of the crystal chamber a beryl palm-tree was figured, with crystal leaves and fruit.
^n257 ‘Then the King thought: 
“Suppose I were to make a grove of palm-trees all of gold by the door of the great gabled chamber where I sit in the daytime?” 
and he did so.
‘Surrounding the Dhamma Palace were two parapets, one of gold, one of silver. 
The gold one had gold posts, silver railings and banisters, 
and the silver one had silver posts, gold railings and banisters.
^n258 ‘The Dhamma Palace was surrounded by two nets of tinkling bells. 

One net was gold with silver bells, the other silver with gold bells. 
And when these nets of bells were stirred by the wind their sound was lovely, delightful, sweet and intoxicating, 
just like that of the five kinds of musical instruments played in concert by well-trained and skilful players. 

And those who were libertines and drunkards in Kusāvatī had their desires assuaged by the sound of those nets of bells.
‘And when the Dhamma Palace was finished, it was hard to look at, dazzling to the eyes, 
just as in the last month of the Rains, in autumn, when there is a clear and cloudless sky, the sun breaking through the mists is hard to look at, 
so was the Dhamma Palace when it was finished.
^n259 ‘Then the King thought: 
“Suppose I were to make a lotus-lake called Dhamma in front of the Dhamma Palace?” 
so he did so. 
This lake was a yojana long from east to west, and half a yojana wide from north to south, and lined with four kinds of tiles, gold, silver, beryl and crystal. 


There were twenty-four staircases to it of four different kinds: 
gold, silver, beryl and crystal. 
The gold staircases had gold posts with silver railings and banisters, 
the silver had gold railings and banisters ... 
(^i[and so on, as verse 22]).












‘The Dhamma Lake was surrounded by seven kinds of palm-trees. 
The sound of the leaves stirred by the wind was lovely, delightful, sweet and intoxicating, 
just like that of the five kinds of musical instruments played in concert by well-trained and skilful players. 

And, Ananda, those who were libertines and drunkards in Kusāvatī had their desires assuaged by the sound of the leaves in the wind. 
‘When the Dhamma Palace and the Dhamma Lake were finished, King Mahāsudassana, having satisfied every wish of those who at the time were ascetics or Brahmins, or revered as such, ascended into the Dhamma Palace.’ 
 ^i[End of first recitation-section] 
^n260 ‘Then King Mahāsudassana thought: 
“Of what kamma is it the fruit, of what kamma is it the result, that I am now so mighty and powerful?” 
Then he thought: 
“It is the fruit, the result of three kinds of kamma: 
of giving, self-control, and abstinence.”^f227
‘Then the King went to the great gabled chamber and, standing at the door, exclaimed: 
“May the thought of lust cease! May the thought of ill-will cease! May the thought of cruelty cease! 
Thus far and no further the thought of lust, of ill-will, of cruelty!”
^n261 ‘Then the King went into the great gabled chamber, sat down cross-legged on the golden couch and, detached from all sense-desires, detached from unwholesome mental states, entered and remained in the first jhāna, which is with thinking and pondering, born of detachment, filled with delight and joy. 
And with the subsiding of thinking and pondering, by gaining inner tranquillity and oneness of mind, he entered and remained in the second jhana, which is without thinking and pondering, born of concentration, filled with delight and joy. 
And with the fading away of delight, remaining imperturbable, mindful and clearly aware, he experienced in himself that joy of which the Noble Ones say: “Happy is he who dwells with equanimity and mindfulness”, he entered and remained in the third jhāna. 
And, having given up pleasure and pain, and with the disappearance of former gladness and sadness, he entered and remained in the fourth jhāna which is beyond pleasure and pain, and purified by equanimity and mindfulness.
^n262 ‘Then the King, emerging from the great gabled chamber, went to the golden gabled chamber and, seated cross-legged on the silver couch, 
stayed pervading first one quarter, then the second, the third and the fourth quarter with a mind filled with loving-kindness. Thus he stayed, spreading the thought of loving-kindness above, below and across, everywhere, always with a mind filled with loving-kindness, abundant, magnified, unbounded, without hatred or ill-will. 
And he did likewise with compassion, 
sympathetic joy, 
and equanimity. ^f228
^n263 ‘Of King Mahasudassana’s eighty-four thousand cities,^f229 his capital Kusāvatī was the chief; 
of his eighty-four thousand palaces Dhamma was the chief; 
of his eighty-four thousand gabled halls the great gabled chamber was the chief; 
his eighty-four thousand couches were of gold, silver, ivory, sandal-wood, covered with fleece, wool, spread with ^i[kadali-deer] hide, with head-covers, with red cushions at both ends; 
of his eighty-four thousand elephants adorned with gold ornaments, with gold banners and spread with gold nets, Uposatha the royal tusker was chief; 

of his eighty-four thousand carriages, covered with lion-skins, tiger-skins, leopard-skins or with orange-coloured cloth, adorned with gold ornaments, gold banners and spread with gold nets, the chariot Vejayanta^f230 was the chief; 
of his eighty-four thousand jewels the Jewel-Treasure was the chief; 
of his eighty-four thousand wives Queen Subhaddā^f231 was the chief; 
of his eighty-four thousand householders the Householder-Treasure was the chief; 
of his eighty-four thousand Khattiya retainers the Counsellor-Treasure was the chief; 
his eighty-four thousand cows had tethers of fine jute and milk-pails (?) of silver;^f232 
his eighty-four thousand bales of clothing were of the finest linen, cotton, silk and wool; 
his eighty-four thousand rice-offerings were there for the taking by those in need, evening and morning.
^n264 ‘And at that time, King Mahasudassana’s eighty-four thousand elephants waited on him evening and morning. 
And he thought: 
“These eighty-four thousand elephants wait on me evening and morning. How if, at the end of each century, forty-two thousand elephants were to wait on me, turn and turn about?” 
And he gave instructions accordingly to his Counsellor-Treasure, and so it was done.



^n265 ‘And, Ananda, after many hundred, many hundred thousand years, Queen Subhadda thought: 
“It is a long time since I saw King Mahasudassana. Suppose I were to go and see him?” 
So she said to her women: 
“Come now, wash your heads and put on clean clothes. 
It is long since we saw King Mahasudassana. We shall go to see him.” 
“Yes, Your Majesty”, they said, and prepared themselves as ordered, then returned to the Queen. 
And Queen Subhadda said to the Counsellor-Treasure : 
“Friend Counsellor, draw up the fourfold army. It is long since we saw King Mahasudassana. We shall go and see him.” 
“Very good, Your Majesty”, said the Counsellor-Treasure and, having drawn up the fourfold army, he reported to the Queen: 
“Now is the time to do 
as Your Majesty wishes.” 
‘Then Queen Subhadda went with the fourfold army and her womenfolk to the Dhamma Palace and, entering, 
went to the great gabled chamber and stood leaning against the door-post. 
And King Mahasudassana, thinking:
 “What is this great noise, as of a crowd of people?” came out of the door and saw Queen Subhadda leaning against the door-post. And he said: 
“Stay there, Queen! Do not enter!”
‘Then King Mahasudassana said to a certain man: 
“Here, fellow, go to the great gabled chamber, bring the gold couch out and lay it down among the gold palm-trees.” 
“Very good, Sire”, said the man, and did so. 
Then King Mahasudassana adopted the lion-posture on his right side with one foot on the other, mindful and clearly aware.^f233
^n266 ‘Then Queen Subhadda thought: 
“King Mahāsudassana’s faculties are purified, his complexion is clear and bright, oh - I hope he is not dead!”^f234 So she said to him: 
“Sire, of your eighty-four thousand cities, Kusavati is the chief. 
Make a wish, arouse the desire to live there!” 
^i[Thus, reminding him of all his royal possessions (as verse]5^i[) she exhorted him to wish to stay alive]. 

























^n267 ‘At this, King Mahasudassana said to the Queen: 
“For a long time, Queen, you spoke pleasing, delightful, attractive words to me, 
but now at this last time your words have been unpleasing, undelightful, unattractive to me.” 
“Sire, how then am I to speak to you?”
‘This is how you should speak: 
“All things that are pleasing and attractive are liable to change, to vanish, to become otherwise. Do not, Sire, die filled with longing. To die filled with longing is painful and blameworthy. 
Of your eighty-four thousand cities, Kusavati is the chief: 
abandon desire, abandon the longing to live with them ... 
Of your eighty-four thousand palaces, Dhamma is the chief: 
abandon desire, abandon the longing to live there...” 
^i[(and so on throughout, as verse 5]). 























^n268 ‘At this, Queen Subhadda cried out and burst into tears. 
Then, wiping away her tears, she said: 
“Sire, all things that are pleasing and attractive are liable to change... 
Do not, Sire, die filled with longing...’



























^n269 ‘Soon after this, King Mahasudassana died; 
and just as a householder or his son might feel drowsy after a good meal, 
so he felt the sensation of passing away, and he had a favourable rebirth in the Brahmā-world.
‘King Mahasudassana indulged in boyish sports for eighty-four thousand years, 
for eighty-four thousand years he exercised the viceroyalty, 
for eighty-four thousand years he ruled as King, 
and for eighty-four thousand years, as a layman, he lived the holy life in the Dhamma Palace.^f235
 And, having practised the four divine abidings, at the breaking-up of the body he was reborn in the Brahmā-world.^f236
^n270 ‘Now, Ānanda, you might think 
King Mahasudassana at that time was somebody else. 
But you should not regard it so, for I was King Mahasudassana then. 
Those eighty-four thousand cities of which Kusavati was the chief were mine,... the eighty-four thousand rice-offerings...were mine.
^n271 ‘And of those eighty-four thousand cities I dwelt in just one, Kusāvatī,... 






of the eighty-four thousand wives I had, just one looked after me, and she was called Khattiyāni or Velāmikāni;^f237 
of the eighty-four thousand bales of cloth I had just one ... ; 
of the eighty-four thousand rice-offerings there was just one measure of choice curry that I ate.
^n272 ‘See, Ananda, how all those conditioned states of the past have vanished and changed! 
Thus, Ananda, conditioned states are impermanent, 
they are unstable, 
they can bring us no comfort, 
and such being the case, Ananda, we should not rejoice in conditioned states, we should cease to take an interest in them, and be liberated from them.
‘Six times, Ānanda, I recall discarding the body in this place, and at the seventh time I discarded it as a wheel-turning monarch, a righteous king who had conquered the four quarters and established a firm rule, and who possessed the seven treasures. 
But, Ananda, I do not see any place in this world with its devas and māras and Brahmās, or in this generation with its ascetics and Brahmins, princes and people, where the Tathāgata will for an eighth time discard the body.’
So the Lord spoke. 
The Well-Farer having said this, the Teacher said:
‘Impermanent are compounded things, 
prone to rise and fall, 
Having risen, they’re destroyed, 
their passing truest bliss.’

^ck#d18(^h[Brahma Addresses the Gods] )^n273 THUS HAVE I HEARD. 
Once the Lord was staying at Nādikā at the Brick House.^f238
 And at that time the Lord was explaining the rebirths of various devotees up and down the country who had died and passed away: Kāsis and Kosalans, Vajjians and Mallas, Cetis and Vamsas, Kurus and Pañcālas, Macchas and Sūrasenas, saying: 
‘This one was reborn there, and that one there.’^f239
 More than fifty Nādikan devotees, having abandoned the five lower fetters, were reborn spontaneously and would attain Nibbāna without returning to this world; 
over ninety of them, having abandoned three fetters and weakened greed, hatred and delusion, were Once-Returners, who would return to this world once more and then make an end of suffering; 
and more than five hundred, having abandoned three fetters, were Stream-Winners, incapable of falling into states of woe, certain of Nibbāna. 
^n274 This news reached the ears of the devotees in Nādikā, and they were pleased, delighted and filled with joy to hear the Lord’s replies.






^n275 And the Venerable Ananda heard of the Lord’s report^f240 and the Nādikans’ delight.






^n276 And he thought: 
‘There were also Magadhan disciples of long standing who have died and passed away. 
One would think Anga and Magadha contained no Magadhan disciples who had died. 
Yet they too were devoted to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and they observed the discipline perfectly. 
The Lord has not stated their destiny. 
It would be good to have a declaration about this: it would make the multitude have faith and so attain a good rebirth.
‘Now King Seniya Bimbisāra of Magadha was a righteous and lawful king, a friend of Brahmins, householders, town and country-dwellers, 
so that his fame is spread abroad: 
“That righteous king of ours is dear^f241 who gave us so much happiness. Life was easy for us who dwelt under his righteous rule.”^f242
 And he was devoted to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and observed the discipline perfectly. 
Thus people say: 
“King Bimbisāra, who praised the Lord to his dying day, is dead!” 
The Lord has not declared his destiny, and it would be good to have a declaration... 

Besides, it was in Magadha that the Lord gained his enlightenment. 
Since the Lord gained his enlightenment in Magadha, why does he not declare the destinies of those who have died there? 
For the Lord not to make such a declaration would cause unhappiness to the Magadhans. 
Such being the case, why does not the Lord make such a declaration?’
^n277 And after thus reflecting in solitude on behalf of the Magadhan devotees, the Venerable Ananda rose at the crack of dawn, went to the Lord and saluted him. Then, sitting down to one side, he said: 
‘Lord, I have heard what has been declared concerning the inhabitants of Nādikā.’ 
(as verse 1-2) 












‘These were all devoted to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and they observed the discipline perfectly. 
The Lord has not stated their destiny... 
(^i[as verse 4]). 






Why does not the Lord make such a declaration?’ 
Then, having thus spoken to the Lord on behalf of the Magadhan devotees, he rose from his seat, saluted the Lord, passed him by to the right, and departed.
^n278 As soon as Ananda had gone, the Lord took his robe and bowl and went into Nādikā for alms. 
Later, on his return, after his meal, he went to the Brick House and, having washed his feet, he went in and, having thought over, considered and given his whole mind to the question of the Magadhan devotees, he sat down on the prepared seat, saying: 
‘I shall know their destiny and future lot, whatever it is.’^f243 
And then he perceived the destiny and fate of each one of them. 

And in the evening, emerging from meditative seclusion, the Lord came out of the Brick House and sat down on the prepared seat in the shade of his lodging.
^n279 Then the Venerable Ananda came to the Lord, saluted him, sat down to one side and said:
 ‘Lord, the Lord’s countenance looks bright and shining, showing that the Lord’s mind is at ease. 
Has the Lord been satisfied with today’s lodging?’
‘Ananda, after you spoke to me about the devotees of Magadha, I took my robe and bowl and went into Nādikā for alms. Later on ... 
I went to the Brick House and considered the question of the Magadhan devotees... 
And I perceived the destiny and fate of each one of them. 
^n280 
“I am Janavasabha, Lord! 
I am Janavasabha, Well-Farer!” 
Well, Ananda, do you know anyone who formerly bore the name of Janavasabha?’ 
‘I must admit, Lord, that I have never heard such a name; and yet, on hearing the name “Janavasabha”^f244
 my hairs stood on end, and I thought: 
“He whose name is Janavasabha will not be such a low-ranking yakkha!”’
‘Ananda, immediately after I heard this voice, the yakkha appeared before me as a noble vision, 
and uttered a second cry: 
“I am Bimbisara, Lord! 
I am Bimbisāra, Well-Farer! 
I have now for the seventh time been reborn into the entourage of the Lord Vessavana.^f245 Thus having passed away as a king of humans, I have now become among the devas a king of non-human beings.
Seven states here and seven there, 
fourteen births, 
That’s the tally of lives 
I can recall.
^n281 For a long time, Lord, I have known myself to be exempt from states of woe, ^f246 and now the desire arises in me to become a Once-Returner.” 
I said: “It is amazing, it is astonishing that the reverend yakkha Janavasabha should say this. 
On what grounds can he know of such an august specific attainment?”
“‘Not otherwise, Lord, not otherwise, Well-Farer, than through your teaching! 
From the time when I became fully committed and gained complete faith, from then on, Lord, for a long time I have known myself to be exempt from states of woe, and the desire has arisen in me to become a Once-Returner. 
And here, Lord, having been sent by King Vessavana on some business to King Virūlhaka,^f247 I saw the Lord entering the Brick House and sitting down and considering the question of the Magadhan devotees ... 

And since I had only just heard King Vessavana announce to his assembly what those folk’s fates were, 

it is no wonder that I thought: 
‘I will go and see the Lord and report this to him.’ 
And these, Lord, are the two reasons^f248 why I came to see the Lord.” ^i[(〕anavasabha continued:)]
^n282 ‘“Lord, in earlier days, long ago, on the fast-day of the fifteenth at the beginning of the Rains,^f249 in the full-moon night all the Thirty-Three Gods were seated in the Sudhamma Hall^f250 - 
a great congregation of divine beings, and the Four Great Kings from the four quarters were there. 
There was the Great King Dhatarattha^f251 from the east at the head of his followers, facing west; 
the Great King Virūlhaka from the south... facing north; 
the Great King Virupakkha from the west...facing east; 
and the Great King Vessavana from the north... facing south. 
‘“On such occasions that is the order in which they are seated, 
and after that came our seats. 
And those devas who, having lived the holy life under the Lord, had recently appeared in the Heaven of the Thirty-Three, outshone the other devas in brightness and glory. 
And for that reason the Thirty-Three Gods were pleased, happy, filled with delight and joy, saying: 
‘The devas’ hosts are growing, the asuras’ hosts are declining!’^f252
‘“Then, Lord, Sakka, ruler of the gods, seeing the satisfaction of the Thirty-Three, uttered these verses of rejoicing:
‘The gods of 
Thirty-Three rejoice, their leader too,
 Praising the Tathagata, 
and Dhamma’s truth, 
Seeing new-come devas, 
fair and glorious 
Who’ve lived the holy life, 
now well reborn. 
Outshining all the rest 
in fame and splendour, 
The mighty 
Sage’s pupils singled out. 
Seeing this, 
the Thirty-Three rejoice, their leader too, 
Praising the Tathagata, 
and Dhamma’s truth.’ 
At this the Thirty-Three Gods rejoiced still more, saying: 
‘The devas’ hosts are growing, the asuras’ hosts are declining!’
‘“And then they consulted and deliberated together about the matter concerning which they had assembled in the Sudhammā Hall, 
and the Four Great Kings were advised and admonished on this matter as they stood by their seats unmoving. ^f253
The Kings, instructed, 
marked the words they spoke, 
Standing calm, serene, 
beside their seats.
^n283 “‘And then, Lord, a glorious radiance shone forth from the north, and a splendour was seen greater than the sheen of the devas.
 And Sakka said to the Thirty-Three Gods: 
‘Gentlemen, when such signs are seen, such light is seen and such radiance shines forth, Brahmā will appear.^f254 The appearance of such radiance is the first sign of Brahmā’s approaching manifestation.’
When they see these signs, 
Brahmā will soon appear: 
This is Brahmā sign, 
radiance vast and great.
^n284 ‘“Then the Thirty-Three Gods sat down each in his proper place, saying: 
‘Let us find out what comes^f255 of this radiance, and having found the truth of it, we will go towards it.’ 
The Four Great Kings, sitting down in their places, said the same. 
Thus they were all agreed.


“‘Lord, whenever Brahmā Sanankumāra^f256 appears to the Thirty-Three Gods, he appears having assumed a grosser form,
 because his natural appearance is not such as to be perceptible to their eyes.^f257
 When he appears to the Thirty-Three Gods, he outshines other devas in radiance and glory, 
just as a figure made of gold outshines the human figure. 

And, Lord, when Brahmā Sanankumāra appears to the Thirty-Three Gods, not one of them salutes him, or rises, or offers him a seat. 
They all sit silently with palms together,^f258 cross-legged, ^f259 thinking 
he will sit down on the couch^f260 of that god from whom he wants something. 
And the one on whose couch he sits down is as thrilled and delighted as 
a duly-anointed Khattiya king on assuming his royal office. 

‘“Then, Lord, Brahmā Sanankumāra, having assumed a grosser form, appeared to the Thirty-Three Gods in the shape of the youth Pañcasikha.^f261
 Rising up in the air, he appeared floating cross-legged, 
just as a strong man might sit down on a properly-spread couch or on the ground. 
And seeing the delight of the Thirty-Three Gods, he uttered these verses of rejoicing:
‘The gods of Thirty-Three rejoice, 
their leader too, 
Praising the Tathāgata, 
and Dhamma’s truth, 
Seeing new-come devas, 
fair and glorious 
Who’ve lived the holy life, 
now well reborn. 
Outshining all the rest in 
fame and splendour, 
The mighty Sage’s pupils 
singled out. 
Seeing this, the Thirty-Three rejoice, 
their leader too, 
Praising the Tathāgata, 
and Dhamma’s truth.’
^n285 “‘Now to the matter of Brahmā Sanankumāra’s speech, 
and as for the manner of his speech, his voice had eight qualities: 
it was distinct, intelligible, pleasant, attractive, compact, concise, deep and resonant. 
And when he spoke in that voice to the assembly, its sound did not carry outside. 
Whoever has such a voice as that is said to have the voice of Brahmā.“‘And Brahmā Sanankumāra, multiplying his shape by thirty-three, sat down cross-legged on each individual couch of the Thirty-Three, and said: 
‘What do my lords the Thirty-Three think? Since the Lord, out of compassion for the world and for the benefit and happiness of the many, has acted to the advantage of devas and mankind, 
those, whoever they may be, who have taken refuge in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha and have observed the moral precepts^f262 have, at death and the breaking-up of the body, arisen in the company of the Parinimmita-Vasavatti devas,^f263 or the Nimmanaratti devas, or the Tusita devas, or the Yāma devas, or in the retinue of the Thirty-Three Gods, or of the Four Great Kings — 
or at the very least in the company of the gandhabbas .’^f264
^n286 ‘“This was the burden of Brahmā Sanankumāra’s speech. 
And every one of the gods he spoke to thought: 
‘He is sitting on my couch, he is speaking to me alone.’
All the forms assumed 
with one voice speak, 
And having spoken, 
all at once are silent. 
And so the Thirty-Three, 
their leader too, 
Each thinks: 
‘He speaks to me alone.’
‘“Then Brahma Sanankumara assumed a single form;^f265 then he sat down on the couch of Sakka and said: 
^n287 This Lord, the Arahant supreme Buddha has known and seen the four roads to power,^f266 and how to develop, perfect and practise them. 
What four? 
Here a monk develops concentration of intention accompanied by effort of will, 
concentration of energy..., 
concentration of consciousness..., 
and concentration of investigation accompanied by effort of will. 
These are the four roads to power... 
And whatever ascetics or Brahmins have in the past realised such powers in different ways, they have all developed and strongly practised these four ways, 
and the same applies to all who may in the future, 
or who do now realise such powers. 
Do my lords the Thirty-Three observe such powers in me?’ 
‘Yes, Brahmā.’ 
‘Well, I too have developed and strongly practised these four ways.’
‘“This was the burden of Brahma Sanankumāra’s speech. 
He went on: 
^n288 There are three gateways to the bliss proclaimed by the Lord who knows and sees. 
What are they? 
In the first place someone dwells in association with sense-desires, with unwholesome conditions. 
At some time he hears the Ariyan Dhamma, he pays close attention and practises in conformity with it. 
By so doing he comes to live dissociated from such sense-desires and unwholesome conditions. 
As a result of this dissociation, pleasant feeling^f267 arises, 
and what is more, gladness.^f268
 Just as pleasure might give birth to rejoicing, so from pleasant feeling he experiences gladness.

‘“‘In the second place there is someone in whom the gross tendencies^f269 of body, speech and thought are not allayed. 
At some time he hears the Ariyan Dhamma, ... 
and his gross tendencies of body, speech and thought are allayed. 
As a result of this allaying, pleasant feeling arises, 
and what is more, gladness...


‘“‘In the third place there is someone who really does not knew what is right and what is wrong, 
what is blameworthy and what is not, what is to be practised and what is not, what is base and what is noble, and what is foul, fair or mixed in quality. 
At some time he hears the Ariyan Dhamma, he pays dose attention and practises in conformity with it. 
As a result, he comes to know in reality what is right and wrong, what is blameworthy and what is not, 
what is to be practised and what is not, what is base and what is noble, and what is foul, fair or mixed in quality. 
In him who knows and sees thus, ignorance is dispelled and knowledge arises. 
With the waning of ignorance and the arising of knowledge, pleasant feeling arises, 
and what is more, gladness. 

Just as pleasure might give birth to rejoicing, so from pleasant feeling he experiences gladness. 
These are the three gateways to the bliss proclaimed by the Lord who knows and sees.’
‘“This was the burden of Brahmā Sanankumāra’s speech. 
He went on: 
^n289 How well has the Lord Buddha who knows and sees pointed out the four foundations of mindfulness^f270 for the attainment of that which is good! 
What are they? 
Here a monk abides contemplating the body as body, earnestly, clearly aware, mindful and having put away all hankering and fretting for the world. 
As he thus dwells contemplating his own body as body, he becomes perfectly concentrated and perfectly serene. 
Being thus calm and serene, he gains knowledge and vision externally of the bodies of others.^f271
 He abides contemplating his own feelings as feelings,... 

he abides contemplating his own mind as mind, ... 

he abides contemplating his own mind-objects as mind-objects, earnestly, clearly aware, mindful and having put away all hankering and fretting for the world. 
As he thus dwells contemplating his own mind-objects as mind-objects, he becomes perfectly concentrated and perfectly serene. 
Being thus calm and serene, he gains knowledge and vision externally of the mind-objects of others. 
These are the four foundations of mindfulness well pointed out by the Lord Buddha who knows and sees, for the attainment of that which is good.’
‘“This was the burden of Brahmā Sanankumāra’s speech. He went on: ‘What do my lords of the Thirty-Three think? How well has the Lord Buddha who knows and sees pointed out the seven requisites of concentration, for the development of perfect concentration and the perfection of concentration! 
What are they? 
^n290  That one-pointedness of mind that is produced by these seven factors is called the Ariyan right concentration with its bases and requisites. 

From right view arises right thought, from right thought arises right speech, from right speech arises right action, from right action arises right livelihood, from right livelihood arises right effort, from right effort arises right mindfulness, from right mindfulness arises right concentration, from right concentration arises right knowledge, ^f272 from right knowledge arises right liberation.^f273


 If anyone truthfully declaring: 
“Well-proclaimed by the Lord is the Dhamma, visible here and now, timeless, inviting inspection, leading onward, to be comprehended by the wise each one for himself”, were to say: “Open are the doors of the Deathless!” ^f274
 he would be speaking in accordance with the highest truth. For indeed, my lords, the Dhamma is well-proclaimed by the Lord, visible here and now, timeless, inviting inspection, leading onward, to be comprehended by the wise, each one for him or herself, and, too, the doors to the Deathless are open!
‘“‘Those who have unshakeable faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and are endowed with the virtues pleasing to the Noble Ones, those beings who have arisen here on account of their Dhamma-training, amounting to more than twenty-four hundred Magadhan followers who have passed over, have by the destruction of three fetters become Stream-Winners, incapable of falling into states of woe and certain of enlightenment, 
and indeed there are Once-Returners here too.
But of that other race indeed 
Of greater merit still, my mind 
Can make no reckoning at all, 
For fear that I should speak untruth.’^f275
^n291 ‘“This was the burden of Brahma Sanankumāra’s speech. And in connection with this the Great King Vessavana reflected in his mind: 
‘It is marvellous, it is wonderful, that such a glorious Teacher should arise, that there should be such a glorious proclamation of Dhamma, and that such glorious paths to the sublime should be made known!’ 
Then Brahmā Sanankumāra, reading King Vessavana’s mind, said to him: 
‘What do you think, King Vessavana? There has been such a glorious Teacher in the past, and such a proclamation, and such paths made known, 
and there will be again in the future.’”’
^n292 Such was the burden of what Brahmā Sanankumāra proclaimed to the Thirty-Three Gods. And the Great King Vessavana, having heard and received it in person, related it to his followers. 
And the yakkha Janavasabha, having heard it himself, related it to the Lord. 
And the Lord, having heard it himself and also come to know it by his own super-knowledge, related it to the Venerable Ananda, who in turn related it to the monks and nuns, the male and female lay-followers.
 And so the holy life waxed mighty and prospered and spread widely as it was proclaimed among mankind.

^ck#d19(^z1[Mahāgovinda Sutta: The Great Steward] ^h[A Past Life of Gotama] )^n293 THUS HAVE I HEARD.^f276 
Once the Lord was staying at Rajagaha, on Vultures’ Peak. 
And when the night was nearly over, Pañcasikha of the gandhabbas,^f277 lighting up the entire Vultures’ Peak with a splendid radiance,^f278 approached the Lord, saluted him, stood to one side and said: 
‘Lord, I wish to report to you what I have personally seen and observed when I was in the presence of the Thirty-Three Gods.’ 
‘Tell me then, Pañcasikha’, said the Lord.
^n294 ‘Lord, in earlier days, long ago, on the fast-day of the fifteenth at the end of the Rains ^i[the Thirty-Three Gods assembled and rejoiced that the devas’ hosts were growing, the asuras’ hosts declining (as Sutta 18, verse 12)]. 










^n295 3. Then Sakka uttered the verse:
“The gods of 
Thirty-Three rejoice, their leader too, 
Praising the Tathagata, 
and Dhamma’s truth, 
Seeing new-come devas, 
fair and glorious 
Who’ve lived the holy life, 
now well reborn. 
Outshining all the rest in 
fame and splendour, 
The mighty Sage’s pupils 
singled out. 
Seeing this, the Thirty-Three rejoice, 
their leader too, 
Praising the Tathagata, 
and Dhamma’s truth.” 
At this, Lord, the Thirty-Three Gods rejoiced still more, saying: 
“The devas’ hosts are growing, the asuras’ hosts are declining!”
^n296 〔Pañcasikha continued:〕 ‘Then Sakka, seeing their satisfaction, said to the Thirty-Three Gods: 
“Would you like, gentlemen, to hear eight truthful statements in praise of the Lord?” 
and on receiving their assent, 
he declared:
‘“What do you think, my lords of the Thirty-Three? 
As regards the way in which the Lord has striven for the welfare of the many, for the happiness of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the welfare and happiness of devas and humans — 
we can find no teacher endowed with such qualities, whether we consider the past or the present, other than the Lord.
‘“Well-proclaimed, truly, is this Lord’s Teaching, visible here and now, timeless, inviting inspection, leading onward, to be realised by the wise each one for himself —
 and we can find no proclaimer of such an onward-leading doctrine, either in the past or in the present, other than the Lord.
“‘The Lord has well explained what is right and what is wrong, 
what is blameworthy and what is blameless, what is to be followed and what is not to be followed, what is base and what is noble, what is foul, fair and mixed in quality.^f279 
And we can find none who is a proclaimer of such things... other than the Lord.
“‘Again, the Lord has well explained to his disciples the path leading to Nibbāna,^f280 
and they coalesce, Nibbāna and the path, just as the waters of the Ganges and the Yamunā coalesce and flow on together. 

And we can find no proclaimer of the path leading to Nibbāna ... other than the Lord.
‘“And the Lord has gained companions, both learners^f281 and those who, having lived the life, have abolished the corruptions,^f282 and the Lord dwells together with them, all rejoicing in the one thing. 
And we can find no such teacher ... other than the Lord.
‘“The gifts given to the Lord are well-bestowed, his fame is well established, so much so that, I think, the Khattiyas will continue to be attached to him, 
yet the Lord takes his food-offering without conceit. 
And we can find no teacher who does this... other than the Lord.
“‘And the Lord acts as he speaks, and speaks as he acts. 
And we can find no teacher who does likewise, in every detail of doctrine ... other than the Lord.
“‘The Lord has transcended doubt,^f283 passed beyond all ‘how’ and ‘why’, he has accomplished his aim in regard to his goal and the supreme holy life. 
And we can find no teacher who has done the like, whether we consider the past or the present, other than the Lord.” 
^n297 ‘And when Sakka had thus proclaimed these eight truthful statements in praise of the Lord, 
the Thirty-Three Gods were even more pleased, overjoyed and filled with delight and happiness at what they had heard in the Lord’s praise.
‘Then certain gods exclaimed: 
“Oh, if only four fully-enlightened Buddhas were to arise in the world and teach Dhamma just like the Blessed Lord! 
That would be for the benefit and happiness of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the benefit and happiness of devas and humans!” 
And some said: 
“Never mind four fully-enlightened Buddhas - three would suffice!” 
and others said: 

“Never mind three — two would suffice!” 

^n298 ‘At this Sakka said: 
“It is impossible, gentlemen, it cannot happen that two fully-enlightened Buddhas should arise simultaneously in a single world-system. That cannot be. 
May this Blessed Lord continue to live long, for many years to come, free from sickness and disease! 
That would be for the benefit and happiness of the many, out of compassion for the world it would be for the benefit and happiness of devas and humans!”
‘Then the Thirty-Three Gods consulted and deliberated together about the matter concerning which they had assembled in the Sudhamma Hall, and the Four Great Kings were advised 
and admonished on this matter as they stood by their seats unmoving:
The Kings, instructed, 
marked the words they spoke, 
Standing calm, serene, 
beside their seats.
^n299 ^i[‘A great radiance was seen, heralding the approach of Brahma. 
All took their proper seats (as Sutta 18, verses 15-17), each hoping Brahmā would sit on his couch]. 






^n300 
















‘Then Brahmā Sanankumāra, having descended from his heaven, and seeing their pleasure, uttered these verses:
“The gods of Thirty-Three rejoice, 
their leader too ... 
” (^i[as above]).













^n301 ^i[‘Brahmā Sanankumāra’s voice had eight qualities (as Sutta 18, verse 19]).



‘Then the Thirty-Three Gods said to Brahmā Sanankumāra: 
“It is well, Brahmā! We rejoice at what we have heard. Sakka, lord of the devas, has also declared eight truthful statements to us about the Lord, at which we also rejoice.” 


^n302 Then Brahmā said to Sakka: 
“It is well, Lord of the devas. “Very well, Great Brahmā”
, said Sakka, and he repeated those eight statements:
“‘What do you think, Lord Brahmā...?” (as verses 5 — 12). 
And Brahmā Sanankumāra was pleased, overjoyed and filled with delight and happiness at what he had heard in the Lord’s praise.





















^n303 ^i[‘Brahmā Sanankumāra assumed a grosser form and appeared in the shape of Pañcasikha (as Sutta 18, verse 18]).^f284
 


And sitting thus cross-legged, 
he said to the Thirty-Three Gods: 
^n304 “For how long has the Blessed Lord been one of mighty wisdom?
“‘Once upon a time there was a king called Disampati. 
His chaplain^f285 was a Brahmin called the Steward.^f286
 The King’s son was a youth called Renu, 
and the Steward’s son was called Jotipāla. 
Prince Renu and Jotipāla, together with six other Khattiyas, formed a band of eight friends. 
In the course of time the Steward died, 
and King Disampati mourned him, saying: 
‘Alas, at the very moment when we had entrusted all our responsibilities to the Steward, and were abandoning ourselves to the pleasures of the five senses, the Steward has passed away!’
“‘Hearing this, Prince Renu said: 
‘Sire, do not mourn the Steward’s death overmuch! 
His son Jotipāla^f287 is cleverer than his father was and has a better eye for what is advantageous. 
You should let Jotipāla manage all the business you entrusted to his father.’ 
‘Is that so, my boy?’ 
‘Yes, Sire.’
^n305 “‘Then the King called a man and said: 
‘Come here, my good man, go to the youth Jotipāla and say: 
”May the Reverend Jotipāla be well! King Disampati sends for you, he would like to see you.”’ 
‘Very good, Your Majesty’, said the man, and delivered the message. 
On receiving the message, 
Jotipāla said: ‘Very good, sir’, and went to see the King. 
On entering the royal presence, he exchanged courtesies with the King, then sat down to one side. The King said: 
‘We wish the Reverend Jotipāla to manage our affairs. Do not refuse. 
I will install you in your father’s place and consecrate^f288 you as Steward.’ 
‘Very good, Lord’, replied Jotipāla.
“‘So King Disampati appointed Jotipāla as steward in his father’s place. 
And once installed, Jotipāla carried out the business his father had carried out, not doing any business his father had not done. 
He accomplished all the tasks his father had accomplished, and no others. 
And people said: 
‘This Brahmin is truly a steward! Indeed he is a great steward!’ 
And that is how the young Brahmin Jotipāla came to be known as the Great Steward.
^n306 “‘And one day the Great Steward went to the group of six nobles and said: 
‘King Disampati is aged, decrepit, stricken with age. His life is near its end and he cannot last much longer. Who can tell how long people will live? 
When King Disampati dies, the king-makers^f289 are bound to anoint Prince Renu as King. 
You should go, gentlemen, to Prince Renu and say: 
”We are the beloved, dear and favoured friends of the Lord Renu, sharing his joys and his sorrows. 
Our Lord King Disampati is aged... 
When he dies, the king-makers are bound to anoint the Lord Renu as King. 
If the Lord Renu should gain the kingship, let him share it with us.”’
‘“‘Very good, sir’, said the six nobles, and they went to Prince Renu and spoke to him as the Great Steward had proposed. 





‘Well, gentlemen, who, apart from myself, ought to prosper but you? 
If, gentlemen, I gain the kingship, I will share it with you.’ 
^n307 ‘“In due course King Disampati died, 
and the king-makers anointed Prince Renu King in his place. 
And having been made King, Renu abandoned himself to the pleasures of the five senses. 
Then the Great Steward went to the six nobles and said: 
‘Gentlemen, now King Disampati is dead the Lord Renu, 
who has been anointed in his place, has abandoned himself to the pleasures of the five senses. 
Who knows what will come of this? The sense-pleasures are intoxicating. 
You should go to him and say: 
”King Disampati is dead and the Lord Renu has been anointed King. Do you remember your word, Lord?”’
^n308 ‘“They did so, and the King said: 

‘Gentlemen, I remember my word. 
Who is there who can divide this mighty realm of earth, so broad in the north and so 〔narrow〕 like the front of a cart^f290 in the south, into seven equal parts?’ 
‘Who indeed, Lord, if not the Great Steward?’
“‘So King Renu sent a man to the 
Great Steward to say: 
‘My lord, the King sends for you.’ 
The man went, 
and the Great Steward came to the King, 
exchanged courtesies with him, 
and sat down to one side. 
Then the King said: ‘My Lord Steward, go and divide this mighty realm of earth, so broad in the north and so narrow like the front of a cart in the south, into seven equal parts.’ 
‘Very good, Sire’, said the Great Steward, and he did so.
‘“And King Renu’s country was in the centre:

^n309  Dantapura to the Kalingas, 
Potaka to the Assakas, 
Mahissati to the Avantis, 
Roruka to the Soviras.  
Mithila to the Videhas, 
Campa to the Angas goes, 
Benares to the Kāsī, 
thus did the Steward dispose. 
^n310  The six nobles were delighted with their respective gains and at the success of the plan: 
‘What we wanted, desired, aimed at and strove for, we have got!’
Sattabhū, Brahmadatta, 
Vessabhū and Bharata, 
Renu and two Dhataratthas, 
these are the seven Bhārat kings.”’^f291
^i[End of first recitation-section] 
^n311 “‘Then the six nobles came to the Great Steward and said: 
‘Reverend Steward, just as you were a beloved, dear and faithful friend to King Renu, 
so you have been to us. 
Please manage our affairs for us! 
We trust you will not refuse.’ 
So he administered the realms of seven anointed kings,^f292 and he also taught the mantras to seven distinguished Brahmins and seven hundred advanced pupils.^f293
^n312 “‘In course of time good reports were spread about concerning the Great Steward: 
‘The Great Steward can see Brahmā with his own eyes, talks with him face to face and consults with him!‘^f294 
And he thought: 
‘Now this good report is being spread about concerning me, 
that I can see Brahmā with my own eyes,... 
but it is not true. 
However, I have heard it said 
by aged and respectable Brahmins, the teachers of teachers, that anyone who withdraws into meditation for the four months of the Rains, developing the absorption on compassion, can see Brahmā with his own eyes, talk with him face to face and consult with him. 
Suppose I were to do this!’^f295
^n313 “‘So the Great Steward went to King Renu 
and told him of the report, and of his wish to go into retreat and develop the absorption on compassion. 





‘And nobody is to come near me except to bring me food.’ 
‘Reverend Steward, do as you think fit.’ 
^n314 “‘The six nobles likewise replied: 
‘Reverend Steward, do as you think fit.’







^n315 ‘“He went to the seven Brahmins and the seven hundred pupils and told them of his intentions, adding: 





‘So, gentlemen, you carry on with reciting the mantras you have heard and learnt, and teach them to each other.’ 


‘Reverend Steward, do as you think fit’, they replied. 
^n316 “‘Then he went to his forty equal-ranking wives, and they said: 
‘Reverend Steward, do as you think fit.’







^n317 zoo the Great Steward erected a new lodging to the east of the city and withdrew there for the four months of the Rains, developing the absorption on compassion, 
and nobody came near him except to bring him food. 
But at the end of four months he felt nothing but dissatisfaction and weariness as he thought: 
‘I heard it said... 
that anyone who withdraws into meditation for the four months of the Rains, developing the absorption on compassion, can see Brahmā with his own eyes...
But I cannot see Brahmā with my own eyes, and cannot talk, discuss or consult with him!’
^n318 “‘Now Brahmā Sanankumāra read his thoughts and, as swiftly as a strong man might stretch out his flexed arm or flex it again, he disappeared from the Brahmā world and appeared before the Great Steward. 
And the Great Steward felt fear and trembling, and his hair stood on end at such a sight as he had never seen before. 
And thus fearful, trembling, with hair standing on end, he addressed Brahmā Sanankumāra in these verses: 
‘O splendid vision, 
glorious and divine, Who are you, Lord? 
I fain would 
know your name.’
‘In highest heaven 
I am known by all: 
Brahmā Sanankumāra — 
know me thus.’
  ‘A seat, and water for the feet, 
and cakes Are fitting for a Brahmā. 
Let the Lord Decide 
what hospitality he would.’^f296
  ‘We accept the gift 
that’s offered: 
now declare 
What it is you wish from us — a boon 
Of profit in this very life, or in the next. 
Say, Lord Steward, what it is you’d have.’
^n319 ‘“Then the Great Steward thought: 
‘Brahmā Sanankumara offers me a boon. 
What shall I choose — benefits in this life, or in that to come?’ 
Then he thought: 
‘I am an expert in matters of advantage in this life, and others consult me about this. 
Suppose I were to ask Brahmā Sanankumāra for something of benefit in the life to come?’ 
And he addressed Brahmā in these verses:
‘I ask Brahmā Sanankumāra this, 
Doubting, him who has no doubts I ask (For others too I ask): 
By doing what 
Can mortals reach the deathless Brahmā world?’
  ‘That man who spurns all possessive thoughts, 
Alone, intent, compassion-filled, 
Aloof from stench, free from lust — 
Established thus, and training thus, 
Can mortals reach the deathless Brahmā world.’^f297
^n320 “”I understand “Spurning possessive thoughts”. 
This means that one renounces one’s possessions, small or great, leaves one’s relatives, few or many, and, shaving off hair and beard, goes forth from the household life into homelessness. 
This is how I understand “Spurning possessive thoughts”. 
I understand “Alone, intent”. 
That means that one goes off on one’s own and chooses a lodging in the forest, at the foot of a tree, in a mountain glen, in a rocky cave, a charnel-ground, in the jungle or on a heap of grass in the open... 

I understand “Compassion-filled”. 
That means that one dwells suffusing one quarter with a mind filled with compassion, then a second, then a third and a fourth quarter. Thus one abides suffusing the whole world, up, down and across, everywhere, all around, with a mind filled with compassion, expanded, immeasurable, free from hatred and ill-will. 
That is how I understand “Compassion-filled”. 
But the Lord’s words about “Aloof from stench” 
I do not understand:
What do you mean, Brahma, by “stench” among men? 
Pray lighten my ignorance, O wise one, on this. 
What hindrance causes man to stink and fester, Heading for hell, from Brahmā-realm cut off?’ 
‘Anger, lying, fraud and cheating, 
Avarice, pride and jealousy, 
Coveting, doubt and harming others, 
Greed and hate, stupor and delusion: 
The loathsome stench that these give off 
Heads man for hell, from Brahmā-realm cut off.’
‘As I understand the Lord’s words about the stench, these things are not easy to overcome if one lives the household life. 
I will therefore go forth from the household life into the homeless state.’ 
‘Reverend Steward, do as you think fit.’
^n321 “‘So the Great Steward went to King Renu and said: 
‘My Lord, please appoint another minister^f298 to manage your affairs. 
I wish to go forth from the household life into homelessness. 
After what Brahmā has told me about the stench of the world, which cannot easily be overcome by one living the household life, 
I am going forth into homelessness:
King Renu, lord of this realm, 
I declare, 
You yourself must rule, 
I’ll counsel you no more!’
‘If anything you lack, 
I’ll make it good, 
If any hurt you, 
my royal arms shall guard you. 
You my father,
 I your son, Steward, stay!’
‘I lack nothing, 
none there is who harms me; 
No human voice I heard — 
at home I cannot stay.’ 
“‘Non-human” - 
what’s he like who calls, 
that you At once abandon 
home and all of us?’
  ‘Before I went on this retreat 
I thought of sacrifice, 
Lighting the sacred fire, 
strewing ^i[kusa]-grass. 
But now — eternal Brahmā^f299 from 
Brahmā-realm’s appeared. 
I asked, he answered: 
I now can stay no more.’
‘Reverend Steward, 
in your words I trust. 
Such words Once heard, 
you had no other course. 
We will follow: 
Steward, be our Master. 
Like a beryl-gem, 
clear, of finest water,
 So purified, 
we’ll follow in your wake.
If the Reverend Steward goes forth from the household life into homelessness, I will do the same. Wherever you go, we will follow.’

^n322 “‘Then the Great Steward went to the six nobles and said to them: 
‘My lords, please appoint another minister to manage your affairs. 
I wish to go forth from the household life into homelessness...’


 And the six nobles went aside and consulted together: 
‘These Brahmins are greedy for money. 
Perhaps we can win the Great Steward round with money.’ 
So they came back to him and said: 
‘Sir, there is plenty of wealth in these seven kingdoms. Take as much as you like.’ 
‘Enough, gentlemen, I have received plenty of wealth from my lords already. 
That is the very thing that 
I am renouncing in order to go forth from the household life into homelessness, 
as I have explained.’
‘“Then the six nobles went aside again and consulted together: 
‘These Brahmins are greedy for women. 
Perhaps we can win the Great Steward round with women.’ 
So they came to him and said: 
‘Sir, there are plenty of women in these seven kingdoms. Take your pick!’ 
‘Enough, gentlemen, I already have forty equal wives, 
and I am leaving them in order to go forth from the household life into homelessness, 
as I have explained.’ 

^n323 “”If the Reverend Steward goes forth from the household life into homelessness, we will do likewise. Wherever you go, we will follow: 
“If you renounce those lusts 
that bind most men,^f300
Exert yourselves, be strong 
and patiently endure! 
This is the path that’s straight, th
e peerless path, 
The path of truth, guarded by the good,
 to Brahma’s realm.”
‘“‘And so, Lord Steward, just wait seven years, 
and then we too will go forth into homelessness. Wherever you go, we will follow.’ 
“”Gentlemen, seven years is far too long, I cannot wait for seven years! 
Who can tell how long people will live? 
We have to go on into the next world, we must learn by means of wisdom, ^f301 we must do what is right and live the holy life, for nothing that is born is immortal. 
Now I am going forth 
as I have explained.’
‘“‘Well, Reverend Steward, just wait six years,... 
five year,... 
four years,... 
three years,... 
two years,... 
one year, and then we too will go forth into homelessness. 
Wherever you go, we will follow.’
‘“‘gentlemen, one year is far too long...’ 



‘Then wait seven months...’


‘“‘Gentlemen, seven months is far too long...’ 


‘Then wait six months,... 
five months,... 
four months,... 
three months,... 
two months,... 
one month,... 
half a month...’
‘“‘Gentlemen, half a month is far too long...’ 




‘Then, Reverend Steward, just wait seven days while we make over our kingdoms to our sons and brothers. At the end of seven days we will go forth into homelessness. Wherever you go, we will follow.’
 ‘Seven is not long, gentlemen. I agree, my lords, to seven days.’
^n324 “‘Then the Great Steward went to the seven Brahmins and their seven hundred advanced pupils, and said to them: 
‘Now, Your Reverences, you must seek another teacher to teach you the mantras. 
I mean to go forth from the household life into homelessness. 
After what Brahma has told me about the stench of the world, which cannot be easily overcome by one living the household life, 
I am going forth into homelessness.’ 
‘Reverend Steward, do not do so! 
There is little power and profit in the homeless life, 
and much power and profit in the life of a Brahmin!‘^f302
 ‘Do not say such things, gentlemen! 
Besides, who has greater power and profit than I have? 
I have been like a king to kings, like Brahma to the Brahmins, like a deity to householders, 
and I am giving all this up in order to go forth from the household life into homelessness, 
as I have explained.’ 

‘If the Reverend Steward goes forth from the household life into homelessness, we will do likewise. Wherever you go, we will follow.’
^n325 ‘“Then the Great Steward went to his forty equal wives and said: 
‘Whichever of you ladies wishes to may go back to her own family and seek another husband. 
I mean to go forth into homelessness...’ 


‘You alone are the kinsman we could wish for, the only husband we want. 
If the Reverend Steward goes forth into homelessness, we will do likewise. Wherever you go, we will follow.’
^n326 ‘“And so the Great Steward, at the end of the seven days, shaved off his hair and beard, donned yellow robes and went forth from the household life into homelessness. 
And with him went the seven anointed Khattiya kings, the seven wealthy and distinguished Brahmins with their seven hundred advanced pupils, his forty equal wives, several thousand Khattiyas, several thousand Brahmins, several thousand householders, even some harem-women. “”
And so, followed by this company, the Great Steward wandered through villages, towns and royal cities. 
And whenever he came to a village or town, he was like a king to kings, like Brahma to the Brahmins, like a deity to householders. 
And in those days, whenever anyone sneezed or stumbled, 
they used to say: 
‘Praise be to the Great Steward! Praise be to the Minister of Seven!’
^n327 ‘“And the Great Steward dwelt suffusing one quarter with a mind filled with loving-kindness, then a second, then a third and a fourth quarter. 
He dwelt suffusing the whole world, up, down and across, everywhere, all around, with a mind filled with compassion,... 
with a mind filled with sympathetic joy,... 
with a mind filled with equanimity,... free from hatred and ill-will. 
And thus he taught his disciples the way to union with the Brahmā-world.
^n328 ‘“And all those who had at that time been the Great Steward’s pupils and had fully mastered his teaching, 
were after death at the breaking-up of the body reborn in a happy sphere, in the Brahmā-world. 
And those who had not fully mastered his teaching were reborn either among the Paranimmita-Vasavatti devas, 
among the Nimmanarati devas,
 among the Tusita devas, 
among the Yama devas, 
among the devas of the Thirty-Three Gods, 
or among the devas of the Four Great Kings. 
And the very lowest realm that any of them attained was that of the gandhabbas. 
Thus the going-forth of all those people was not fruitless or barren, but productive of fruit and profit.”
^n329 ‘Do you remember this, Lord?’ 
‘I do, Pañcasikha. 
At that time I was the Brahmin, the Great Steward, 
and I taught those disciples the path to union with the Brahmā-world.
‘However, Pañcasikha, ^i[that] holy life does not lead to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to super-knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbana, but only to birth in the Brahmā-world, 
whereas my holy life leads unfailingly to disenchantment, to dispassion, to cessation, to peace, to super-knowledge, to enlightenment, to Nibbana. 
That is the Noble Eightfold Path, 

namely Right View, Right Thought, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, Right Concentration.

^n330 ‘And, Pañcasikha, those of my disciples who have fully mastered my teaching have by their own super-knowledge realised, by the destruction of the corruptions in this very life, the uncorrupted freedom of heart and mind. 
And of those who have not fully mastered it, some by the destruction of the five lower fetters will be reborn spontaneously, attaining thence to Nibbana without returning to this world; 
some by the destruction of three fetters and the reduction of greed, hatred and delusion will become Once-Returners, who will return once more to this world before making an end of suffering; 
and some by the destruction of three fetters will become Stream-Winners, incapable of falling into states of woe, assured of enlightenment. 
Thus the going-forth of all these people was not fruitless or barren, but productive of fruit and profit.’
 Thus the Lord spoke, 
and Pañcasikha of the gandhabbas was delighted and rejoiced at the Lord’s words. And, having saluted him, he passed him by on the right and vanished from the spot.

^ck#d20(^z1[Mahāsamaya Sutta: The Mighty Gathering] ^h[Devas Come to See the Buddha] )^n331 THUS HAVE I HEARD.^f303 
Once the Lord was staying among the Sakyans in the Great Forest at Kapilavatthu, with a large company of some five hundred monks, all Arahants. 
And devas from ten world-systems^f304 frequently came there to visit the Lord and his order of monks.
And it occurred to four devas of the Pure Abodes:^f305
 ‘The Blessed Lord is staying at Kapilavatthu, with a large company of some five hundred monks, all Arahants. 

What if we were to approach him, and each recite a verse?’
^n332 Then those devas, as swiftly as a strong man might stretch his flexed arm, or flex it again, vanished from the Pure Abodes and appeared before the Lord. 
Then they saluted him and stood to one side, 
and one of them recited this verse:
‘Great the assembly in the forest here, 
the devas have met 
And we are here to see 
the unconquered brotherhood.’ 
Another said:
‘The monks with concentrated minds 
are straight: 
They guard their senses 
as the driver does his reins.’
Another said:
‘Bars and barriers broken, 
the threshold-stone of lust torn up, 
Unstained the spotless seers go, 
like well-trained elephants.’ 
And another said:
‘Who takes refuge in the Buddha, 
no downward path will go:
Having left the body 
he’ll join the deva hosts.’
^n333 Then the Lord said to his monks: 
‘Monks, it has often happened that the devas from ten world-systems have come to see the Tathāgata and his order of monks. 
So it has been with the supreme Buddhas of the past, and so it will be with those of the future, as it is with me now. 
I will detail for you the names of the groups of devas, 


announce them and teach them to you. 
Pay close attention, and I will speak.’ 
‘Yes, Lord’, said the monks, 
^n334  and the Lord said:
5. ‘I’ll tell you them in verse: to which realm each belongs. 
But those who dwell composed 
and resolute Like lions 
in mountain-caves, 
have overcome 
Hair-raising fear and dread, 
their minds White and pure,
 unstained and calm.’^f306  
In Kapilavatthu’s wood the Lord perceived 
Five hundred of his Arahants and more, 
Lovers of his word. To them he said: 
‘Monks, observe the 
deva-host approach!’ 
And the monks strove eagerly to see.
With superhuman vision 
thus arising, 
Some saw a hundred gods, 
a thousand some. 
While some saw 
seventy thousand, 
others saw 
Gods innumerable, all around. 
And 
He-Who-Knows-with-Insight was aware 
Of all that they 
could see and understand.
 And to the lovers of his word the Lord, 
Turning said: 
‘The deva-hosts approach. 
Look and seek to know them, monks, in turn, 
As I declare their names 
to you in verse!’^f307
^n335 ‘Seven thousand yakkhas of 
Kapila’s realm, 
Well-endowed with power 
and mighty skills, 
Fair to see, with splendid train have come 
Rejoicing to this wood to see such monks. 
And six thousand yakkhas 
from Himālaya, 
Of varied hue, and well-endowed with powers, 
Fair to see, with splendid train have come 
Rejoicing to this wood 
to see such monks.
 From Sāta’s Mount three thousand 
yakkhas more Of varied hue...
 The sum is sixteen thousand yakkhas all, 
Of varied hue... 








Of Vessāmitta’s host five hundred more Of varied hue...

 



Kumbhira too from Rājagaha comes 
(Whose dwelling-place is on Vepulla’s slopes): 

A hundred thousand yakkhas follow him.


^n336 King Dhatarattha,^f308 
ruler of the East, 
The gandhabbas’ Lord, a mighty king, 
Has come with retinue. 
Many sons Are his, 
who all bear Indra’s name, 
All well-endowed with mighty skills...
 


King Virūḷha, ruler of the South, 
The Kumbaṇḍhas’ lord, a mighty king...








Virūpakkha, 
ruler of the West, 
Lord of nāgas and a mighty king...







King Kuvera, 
ruler of the North, 
Lord of yakkhas and a mighty king... 



 



From the East King Dhatarattha shone, 
From South Virūḷhaka, 
and from the West Virūpakkha, 
Kuvera from the North: 
Thus ranged in Kapilavatthu’s wood 
The Four Great Kings 
in all their splendour stood.’

^n337 With them came their vassals versed in guile, 
Skilled deceivers all: 
Kutendu first, Then Vetendu, 
Vitu and Vitucca, 
Candana and Kāmaseṭṭha next, 
Kinnughandu and Nighaṇḍu, these, 
Panāda, Opamañña, 
Mātali (Who was the devas’ charioteer), Nala, 
Cittasena of the gandhabbas, 
Rājā, Janesabha, 
Pañcasikha, 
Timbarū with Suriyavaccasā His daughter — 
these, 
and more, 
rejoicing came 
To that wood to see the Buddha’s monks.
^n338 From Nabhasa, 
Vesāli, Tacchaka Came Nāgas, 
Kambalas, Assataras, 
Payāgas with their kin. 
From Yamunā Dhatarattha 
came with splendid host, 
Erāvana too, the mighty nāga chief^f309
To the forest meeting-place has come.
 And the twice-born,^f310 
winged and clear of sight, 
Fierce garuda birds (the nāgas’ foes) have come 
Flying here — Citra and Supaṇṇā. 
But here the nāga kings are safe: 
the Lord Has imposed a truce. 
With gentle speech 
They and the nāgas share the Buddha’s peace.
^n339 Asuras too, whom Indra’s hand^f311 once struck, 
Ocean-dwellers now, 
in magic skilled, 
Vāsava’s replendent brothers came, 
The Kālakañjas, terrible to see, 
Dānaveghasas, 
Vepacitti, Sucitti 
and Pahārādha too, Fell Namuci, 
and Bali’s hundred sons 
(Who all were called Veroca) 
with a band Of warriors 
who joined their master Rāhu, 
Who had come to 
wish their meeting well.
^n340 Gods of water, earth, 
and fire, and wind, 
The Varunas and their retainers. 
Soma And Yasa too. 
Devas born of love And compassion, 
with a splendid train, 
These ten, 
with tenfold varied hosts, 
Endowed with mighty powers, 
and fair to see, 
Rejoicing came to see 
the Buddha’s monks.
Veṇhu^f312 too with his Sahalis came, 
The Asamas, the Yama twins, 
and those Devas who attend on moon and sun, 



Constellation-gods, 
sprites of clouds, 
Sakka the Vasus’ lord, 
ancient giver,^f313
These ten, with tenfold varied hosts...





The Sahabhus, 
radiant, bright, came next, Fiery-crested. 
The Aritthakas, The Rojas, 
cornflower-blue, 
with Varuṇā And Sahadhamma, 
Accuta, Anejaka, 
Sūleyya, Rucira, 
the Vasavanesis, 
These ten, with tenfold varied hosts...





The Samanas and Mahā-Samānas both, 
Beings manlike and more than manlike came, 
The ‘Pleasure-corrupted’ 
and ‘Mind-corrupted’ gods,^f314
Green devas, 
and the red ones too, 
Paragas, Mahā-Pāragas with train, 

These ten, with tenfold varied hosts...





Sukkas, Karumhas, Arunas, Veghanasas, 
Follow in the Odatagayhas’ wake. 


Vicakkhanas, Sadamattas, 
Haragajas, Those gods called ‘Mixed in Splendour’, 
and Pajunna The Thunderer, 
who also causes rain, 
These ten, with tenfold varied hosts... 





The Khemiyas, the Tusitas and Yamas, 
The Katthakas with train, 
Lambitakas, The Lama chiefs, 
and the gods of flame (The Asavas), 
those who delight in shapes 
They’ve made, and those who seize on others’ work,^f315
These ten, with tenfold varied hosts...





These sixty deva-hosts, 
of varied kinds, 
All came arranged in order of their groups, 
And others too, in due array. They said: 
‘He who’s transcended birth, he for whom 
No obstacle remains, who’s crossed the flood, 
Him, cankerless, we’ll see, the Mighty One, 
Traversing free without transgression, as It were the moon that passes through the clouds.’
^n341 Subrahma next, and with him Paramatta, 
Sanankumara, Tissa, 
who were sons 
Of the Mighty One, these also came. 
Mahā-Brahmā, who ruled a thousand worlds, 
In the Brahmā-world supreme, arisen there, 
Shining bright, and terrible to see, 
With all his train. 
Ten lords of his who each 
Rule a Brahmā-world, 
and in their midst 
Harita, who ruled a hundred thousand.
^n342 And when all these had come in vast array, 
With Indra and the hosts of Brahma too, 
Then too came Mara’s hosts, 
and now observe That Black One’s folly.^f316
 For he said: ‘Come on, seize and bind them all! 
With lust We’ll catch them all! 
Surround them all about, 
Let none escape, 
whoever he may be!’ 
Thus the war-lord urged his murky troops. 
With his palm he struck the ground, 
and made A horrid din, 
as when a storm-cloud bursts 
With thunder, lightning and 
with heavy rain — And then — 
shrank back, enraged, but powerless!
^n343 And He-Who-Knows-by-Insight 
saw all this 
And grasped its meaning. 
To his monks he said: 
‘The hosts of Mara come, 
monks — pay good heed!’ 
They heard the Buddha’s words, 
and stayed alert.
And Mara’s hosts drew back from those on whom 
Neither lust nor fear could gain a hold.
‘Victorious, transcending fear, 
they’ve won: 
His followers rejoice 
with all the world!′^f317

^ck#d21(^z1[Sakkapañha Sutta: Sakka’s Questions] ^h[A God Consults the Buddha] )^n344 THUS HAVE I HEARD.^f318 
Once the Lord was staying in Magadha, to the east of Rājagaha, by a Brahmin village called Ambasaṇḍā, to the north of the village on Mount Vediya, in the Indasāla Cave.^f319
 And at that time Sakka, lord of the gods,^f320 felt a strong desire to see the Lord. 
And Sakka thought: 
‘Where is the Blessed Lord, the fully-enlightened Buddha, now staying?’ 
Then, perceiving where the Lord was, 
Sakka said to the Thirty-Three Gods: 
‘Gentlemen, the Blessed Lord is staying in Magadha...in the Indasāla Cave. 
How would it be if we were to go and visit the Lord?’ 
‘Very good, Lord, and may good fortune go with you’, replied the Thirty-Three Gods.
^n345 Then Sakka said to Pañcasikha of the gandhabbas: 
‘The Blessed Lord is staying in Magadha...
in the Indasāla Cave. I propose to go to visit him.’ 
‘Very good, Lord’, said Pañcasikha and, taking his yellow ^i[beluva]-wood lute,^f321 
^n346 he followed in attendance on Sakka. 
And, just as swiftly as a strong man might stretch forth his flexed arm, or flex it again, Sakka, surrounded by the Thirty-Three Gods and attended by Pañcasikha, vanished from the heaven of the Thirty-Three and appeared in Magadha... 
on Mount Vediya.
Then a tremendous light shone over Mount Vediya, illuminating the village of Ambasaṇḍā — so great was the power of the gods — so that in the surrounding villages they were saying: 
‘Look, Mount Vediya is on fire today — it’s burning — it’s in flames! 
What is the matter, that Mount Vediya and Ambasaṇḍā are lit up like this?’ 
and they were so terrified that their hair stood on end.
^n347 Then Sakka said: 
‘Pañcasikha, it is hard for the likes of us to get near the Tathāgatas when they are enjoying the bliss of meditation,^f322 and therefore withdrawn. 
But if you, Pañcasikha, were first to attract^f323 the ear of the Blessed Lord, then we might afterwards be able to approach and see the Blessed Lord, the fully-enlightened Buddha.’ 
‘Very good, Lord’, said Pañcasikha and, taking his yellow beluva-wood lute, he approached the Indasāla Cave. Thinking: 
‘As far as this is neither too far nor too near to the Lord, and he will hear my voice’, 
he stood to one side. 
^n348 
‘Lady, your father Timbarū greet, Oh Sunshine^f324 fair, 
I give him honour due, 
By whom was sired a maid as fair as you 
Who are the cause of all my heart’s delight.
  Delightful as the breeze to one who sweats, 
Or as a cooling draught to one who thirsts, 
Your radiant beauty is to me as dear 
As the Dhamma is to Arahants. 
  Just as medicine to him who’s ill, 
Or nourishment to one who’s starving still, 
Bring me, gracious lady, sweet release 
With water cool from my consuming flames.
 The elephant, oppressed by summer heat,^f325
Seeks out a lotus-pool upon which float 
Petals and pollen of that flower, 
So into your bosom sweet I’d plunge.
 As an elephant, urged by the goad, 
Pays no heed to pricks of lance and spear, 
So I, unheeding, know not what I do, 
Intoxicated by your beauteous form.
 By you my heart is tightly bound in bonds, 
All my thoughts are quite transformed, and 
I Can no longer find my former course: 
I’m like a fish that’s caught on baited hook.
 Come, embrace me, maiden fair of thighs,^f326
Seize and hold me with your lovely eyes, 
Take me in your arms, it’s all I ask! 
My desire was slight at first, O maid 
Of waving tresses, but it grew apace, 
As grow the gifts that 
Arahants receive.
 Whatever merit 
I have gained by gifts 
To those Noble Ones, may my reward 
When it ripens, 
be your love, most fair! 
 



As the Sakyans’ Son in jhāna rapt 
Intent and mindful, 
seeks the deathless goal, 
Thus intent I seek your love, my Sun!
 Just as that Sage would be rejoiced, if he 
Were to gain supreme enlightenment, 
So I’d rejoice 
to be made one with you.^f327 
If Sakka, 
Lord of Three-and-Thirty Gods 
Were perchance to grant a boon to me, 
It’s you I’d crave, my love for you’s so strong.
 Your father, maid so wise, 
I venerate Like a ^i[sāl]-tree fairly blossoming, 
For his offspring’s sake, 
so sweet and fair.’
^n349 When he heard this, the Lord said: 
′Pañcasikha, the sound of your strings blends so well with your song, and your song with the strings, 
that neither prevails excessively over the other.^f328
 When did you compose these verses on the Buddha, the Dhamma, the Arahants, and love?’ 
‘Lord, it was when the Blessed Lord was staying on the bank of the River Nerañjarā, under the goatherd’s ^i[banyan] tree prior to his enlightenment. 
At that time I fell in love with the lady Bhaddā, bright as the sun, the daughter of King Timbarū of the gandhabbas. 
But the lady was in love with somebody else. 
It was Sikhaddi, the son of Mātali the charioteer, whom she favoured. 
And when I found that I could not win the lady by any manner of means, 
I took my yellow ^i[beluva-]wood lute and went to the home of King Timbarū of the gandhabbas, and there I sang these verses:
(Verses as 5). 








‘And, Lord, having heard the verses the lady Bhaddā Suriyavaccasā said to me: 
“Sir, I have not personally seen that Blessed Lord, though I heard of him when I went to the Sudhammā Hall of the Thirty-Three Gods to dance. 
And since, sir, you praise that Blessed Lord so highly, let us meet today.” 
And so, Lord, I met the lady, 
not then but later.’
^n350 Then Sakka thought: 
‘Pañcasikha and the Lord are in friendly conversation’, 
so he called to Pañcasikha: 
‘My dear Pañcasikha, salute the Blessed Lord from me, saying: 
“Lord, Sakka, king of the gods, together with his ministers and followers, pays homage at the feet of the Blessed Lord.”’ 
‘Very good, Lord’, said Pañcasikha, 
and did so.
′Pañcasikha, may Sakka, king of the gods, his ministers and followers be happy, for they all desire happiness: 
devas, humans, asuras, nāgas, gandhabbas, and whatever other groups of beings there are!’ for that is the way the Tathāgatas greet such mighty beings. 
^n351 After this greeting, Sakka entered the Indasāla Cave, 
saluted the Lord, and stood to one side, 
and the Thirty-Three Gods, 
with Pañcasikha, did the same.
Then in the Indasāla Cave the rough passages became smooth, the narrow parts became wide, and in the pitch-dark cavern it became bright, owing to the power of the devas. 
^n352 Then the Lord said to Sakka: 
‘It is wonderful, it is marvellous that the Venerable Kosiya,^f329 with so much, so many things to do, should come here!’ 
‘Lord, I have long wished to visit the Blessed Lord, but I have always been so busy on behalf of the Thirty-Three that I was unable to come. 
Once the Blessed Lord was staying at Savatthi in the Salala hut, 
and I went to Savatthi to see the Lord.
‘At that time the Blessed Lord was seated in some form of meditation, and King Vessavana’s wife Bhuñjatī was waiting on him, venerating him with palms together. 
I said to her: 
“Lady, please salute the Blessed Lord for me and say: 
‘Sakka, the king of the gods, with his ministers and followers, pays homage at the Lord’s feet’. 
But she said: 
“Sir, it is not the right time to see the Blessed Lord, 
he is in retreat.” 
“Well then, lady, when the Blessed Lord rises from his meditation, 
please tell him what I have said.” 
Lord, did the lady salute you on my behalf, 
and does the Lord remember what she said?’ 
‘She did salute me, King of the Gods, and I remember what she said. 
I also remember that it was the sound of Your Reverence’s chariot-wheels that roused me from my meditation. ′^f330 
‘Lord, those gods who arose in the heaven of the Thirty-Three before I did have told me and assured me that 
whenever a Tathāgata, a fully-enlightened Arahant Buddha arises in the world, the ranks of devas increase, and those of the asuras decline in numbers. 
In fact I have witnessed this myself. 
^n353 There was, Lord, right here in Kapilavatthu a Sakyan girl called Gopikā who had faith in the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Sangha, and who observed the precepts scrupulously. 
Then, after her death, at the breaking-up of the body, she went to a happy destination, being reborn in a heaven-state among the Thirty-Three Gods, 
as one of our sons, becoming known as Gopaka the devas’ son.^f331
 

Also, there were three monks who, having observed the holy life under the Blessed Lord, had been reborn in the inferior condition of gandhabbas. 
They lived indulging in the pleasures of the five senses, as our attendants and servants. 
At this, Gopaka rebuked them, saying: 
“What were you about, sirs, that you did not listen to the Blessed Lord’s teaching? 
I was a woman who had faith in the Buddha...I rejected the status of a woman ... and was reborn among the Thirty-Three Gods and am known as Gopaka the devas’ son. 


But you, after having observed the holy life under the Blessed Lord, have been reborn in the inferior condition of gandhabbas! It is a sorry sight for us to see our fellows in the Dhamma reborn in the inferior condition of gandhabbas!” 
And being thus rebuked, two of those devas immediately developed mindfulness, ^f332 and so attained to the Realm of the Retinue of Brahma. ^f333 
But one of them remained addicted to sensual pleasures.
^n354 〔Gopaka spoke:〕 ′′′Disciple once of Him-Who-Sees, 
The name I bore then Gopikā. 
In Buddha, Dhamma firmly trusting 
I served the Sangha cheerfully. 
For loyal service paid to him 
See me now, a Sakka-son, 
Mighty, in the Threefold Heaven,^f334
Resplendent; Gopaka my name. 
Then former monks I saw, who’d reached 
No higher than gandhabba’s rank, 
Who before had human birth 
And led the life the Buddha taught. 
We supplied their food and drink 
And waited on them in our homes.^f335
 Had they no ears, that they thus blest 
Still could not grasp the Buddha’s law? 
Each for himself must understand
 That Dhamma taught by Him-Who-Sees, 
And well-proclaimed. 
I, serving you, 
Heard the Noble Ones’ good words, 
And so I’m born, a Sakka-son, Mighty,
 in the Threefold Heaven,
 And resplendent, whereas you, 
Though you served the Prince of Men 
And led the matchless life he taught, 
Have reappeared in humble state, 
And not attained your proper rank, 
A sorry sight it is to see One’s Dhamma-fellows sunk so low 
That, gandhabba-spirits, you 
But come to wait upon the gods, 
While as for me — I am transformed! 
From household life, and female, I Am now reborn a male, a god, 
Rejoicing in celestial bliss!”
When thus rebuked by Gopaka, Disciple true of Gotama, 
In sore distress they all replied: 
“Alas, let’s go, and strive amain, 
And be no longer others’ slaves!” 
And of the three, two struggled hard, 
And bore in mind the Teacher’s word. 
They purified their hearts of lust, 
Perceiving peril in desires, 
And like the elephant that bursts 
All restraining bonds, they broke 
The fetters and the bonds of lust, Those fetters of the evil one 
So hard to overcome — and thus The very gods, the Thirty-Three, 
With Indra and Pajāpati, 
Who sat enthroned in Council Hall, 
These two heroes, passions purged, 
Outstripped, and left them far behind.
On seeing which, Vasava,^f336 dismayed, 
Chief amidst that throng of gods, Cried: 
“See how these of lesser rank 
Outstrip the gods, the Thirty-Three!” 
Then hearing of his ruler’s fears, 
Gopaka said to Vasava: 
“Lord Indra, in the world of men A Buddha, called the Sakyan Sage,^f337
Has gained the mastery of lust, 
And these his pupils, who had failed 
In mindfulness when claimed by death, 
Have now regained it with my help. 
Though one of them is left behind 
And still among gandhabbas dwells, 
These two, on highest wisdom set, 
In deep absorption spurn the gods! 
Let no disciple ever doubt 
That truth may yet be realised By those who dwell in these abodes.^f338
To him who’s crossed the flood and made An end of doubts, our homage due, 
The Buddha, Victor, Lord, we give.”
Even here, they gained the truth, and so 
Have passed beyond to greater eminence. 
Those two have gained a higher place than this In Realms of Brahmā′s Retinue. 
And we Have come, O Lord, 
in hope that we may gain 
That truth, and, if the Lord will give us leave, 
To put our questions to the Blessed Lord.’
^n355 Then the Lord thought: 
‘Sakka has lived a pure life for a long time. 
Whatever questions he may ask will be to the point and not frivolous, and he will be quick to understand my answers.’ 
^n356 So the Blessed Lord replied to Sakka in this verse:
‘Ask me, Sakka, 
all that you desire! 
On what you ask, 
I′ll put your mind at rest.’
^i[End of first recitation-section〕]  
^n357 Being thus invited, Sakka, ruler of the gods, put his first question to the Lord: 
‘By what fetters, sir,^f339 are beings bound — gods, humans, asuras, nāgas, gandhabbas and whatever other kinds there may be — 
whereby, although they wish to live without hate, harming, hostility or malignity, and in peace, they yet live in hate, harming one another, hostile and malign? 
′ This was Sakka’s first question to the Lord, 
and the Lord replied: 
‘Ruler of the Gods, it is the bonds of jealousy and avarice^f340 that bind beings so that, though they wish to live without hate,... 
they yet live in hate, harming one another, hostile and malign.’ 
This was the Lord’s reply, 
and Sakka, delighted, exclaimed: 
‘So it is, Lord, so it is, Well-Farer! 
Through the Lord’s answer I have overcome my doubt and got rid of uncertainty!’
^n358 Then Sakka, having expressed his appreciation, asked another question: 
‘But sir, what gives rise to jealousy and avarice, what is their origin, how are they born, how do they arise? 
Owing to the presence of what do they arise, 
owing to the absence of what do they not arise?’ 
‘Jealousy and avarice, Ruler of the Gods, take rise from like and dislike,^f341 this is their origin, this is how they are born, how they arise. 
When these are present, they arise; 
when these are absent, they do not arise.’ 
‘But, sir, what gives rise to like and dislike?... 
Owing to the presence of what do they arise, owing to the absence of what do they not arise?’ 
‘They arise, Ruler of the Gods, from desire^f342... 


Owing to the presence of desire they arise, owing to the absence of desire they do not arise.’ 
‘But, sir, what gives rise to desire?...’ 
‘Desire, Ruler of the Gods, arises from thinking^f343... 


When the mind thinks about something, desire arises; 
when the mind thinks about nothing, desire does not arise.’ 
‘But, sir, what gives rise to thinking? ...′ ′Thinking, Ruler of the Gods, arises from the tendency to proliferation^f344 ... 



When this tendency is present, thinking arises; 
when it is absent, thinking does not arise.’
‘Well, sir, what practice has that monk undertaken,^f345 who has reached the right way which is needful and leading to the cessation of the tendency to proliferation?’ 
^n359 ‘Ruler of the Gods, I declare that there are two kinds of happiness:^f346
 the kind to be pursued, and the kind to be avoided. 
The same applies to unhappiness^f347 and equanimity.^f348
 Why have I declared this in regard to happiness? 
This is how I understood happiness: 
When I observed that in the pursuit of such happiness, unwholesome factors increased and wholesome factors decreased, then that happiness was to be avoided. 
^n360 And when I observed that in the pursuit of such happiness unwholesome factors decreased and wholesome ones increased, 



then that happiness was to be sought after. 
Now, of such happiness as is accompanied by thinking and pondering,^f349 and of that which is not so accompanied, the latter is the more excellent. 


^n361 The same applies to unhappiness, 







^n362 and to equanimity. 







^n363 And this, Ruler of the Gods, is the practice that monk has undertaken who has reached the right way...leading to the cessation of the tendency to proliferation.’ 

And Sakka expressed his delight at the Lord’s answer.


^n364 Then Sakka, having expressed his appreciation, asked another question: 
‘Well, sir, what practice has that monk undertaken who has acquired the restraint required by the rules?′^f350 
‘Ruler of the Gods, I declare that there are two kinds of bodily conduct: 
the kind to be pursued, and the kind to be avoided. 
The same applies to conduct of speech and to the pursuit of goals. 



Why have I declared this in regard to bodily conduct? 
This is how I understood bodily conduct: 
When I observed that by the performance of certain actions, unwholesome factors increased and wholesome factors decreased, then that form of bodily action was to be avoided. 

And when I observed that by the performance of such actions unwholesome factors decreased and wholesome ones increased, then such bodily action was to be followed. 
That is why I make this distinction. 


The same applies to conduct of speech 






and the pursuit of goals. 






And this, Ruler of the Gods, is the practice that monk has undertaken who has acquired the restraint required by the rules.’ 

And Sakka expressed his delight at the Lord’s answer.


^n365 Then Sakka asked another question: 
‘Well, sir, what practice has that monk undertaken who has acquired control of his sense-faculties?’
‘Ruler of the Gods, I declare that things perceived by the eye are of two kinds: 
the kind to be pursued, and the kind to be avoided. 
The same applies to things perceived by the ear, 

the nose, 

the tongue, 

the body and the mind.’ 



At this, Sakka said: 
‘Lord, I understand in full the true meaning of what the Blessed Lord has outlined in brief. 
Lord, whatever object perceived by the eye, if its pursuit leads to the increase of unwholesome factors and the decrease of wholesome ones, that is not to be sought after; 
if its pursuit leads to the decrease of unwholesome factors and the increase of wholesome ones, such an object is to be sought after. 
And the same applies to things perceived by the ear, 
the nose, 
the tongue, 
the body 
and the mind. 

Thus I understand in full the true meaning of what the Blessed Lord has outlined in brief, 
and thus through the Lord’s answer I have overcome my doubt and got rid of uncertainty.’
^n366 Then Sakka asked another question: 
‘Sir, do all ascetics and Brahmins teach the same doctrine, practise the same discipline, want the same thing^f351 and pursue the same goal?’ 
‘No, Ruler of the Gods, they do not.’ 
‘But why, sir, do they not do so?’ 
‘The world, Ruler of the Gods, is made up of many and various elements. 
Such being the case, beings adhere to one or other of these various things, and whatever they adhere to they become powerfully addicted to, and declare: 
‘This alone is the truth, everything else is false!’ 
Therefore they do not all teach the same doctrine, practise the same discipline, want the same thing, pursue the same goal.’
‘Sir, are all ascetics and Brahmins fully proficient, freed from bonds, perfect in the holy life, have they perfectly reached the goal?’ 
‘No, Ruler of the Gods.’ 
‘Why is that, sir?’ 
‘Only those, Ruler of the Gods, who are liberated by the destruction of craving are fully proficient, freed from the bonds, perfect in the holy life, and have perfectly reached the goal.’ 


And Sakka rejoiced at the answer as before.


^n367 Then Sakka said: 
′Passion,^f352 sir, is a disease, a boil, a dart. 
It seduces a man, drawing him into this or that state of becoming, so that he is reborn in high states or low. 
Whereas other ascetics and Brahmins of differing viewpoints gave me no chance to ask these questions, the Lord has instructed me at length, 
and thus removed the dart of doubt and uncertainty from me.’ 
‘Ruler of the Gods, do you admit to having asked the same question of other ascetics and Brahmins?’ 
‘Yes, Lord.’ 
‘Then, if you don′t mind, please tell me what they said.’ 
‘I do not mind telling the Blessed Lord, or one like him.′^f353 
‘Then tell me, Ruler of the Gods.’
‘Lord, I went to those I considered to be ascetics and Brahmins because of their solitary life in the woods, and I put these questions to them. But instead of giving me a proper answer,^f354 they asked me in return: 
“Who are you, Venerable Sir?” 
I replied that 
I was Sakka, ruler of the gods, 
and they asked me 
what had brought me there. 
Then I taught them the Dhamma as far as I had heard it and practised it. 
But they were very pleased with even that much, and they said: 
“We have seen Sakka, the ruler of the gods, and he has answered the questions we put to him!” 
And they became my pupils instead of my becoming theirs. 
But I, Lord, am a disciple of the Blessed Lord, a Stream-Winner, not subject to rebirth in states of woe, firmly established and destined for full enlightenment. ′^f355 
^n368 ‘Ruler of the Gods, do you admit to having ever previously experienced rejoicing and happiness such as you experience now?’ 

‘And what was that about?’ 
‘In the past, Lord, war had broken out between the gods and the asuras,
 and the gods had defeated the asuras. 
And after the battle, as victor, I thought: 
“Whatever is now the food of the gods,^f356 and what is the food of the asuras, henceforth we shall enjoy both.” 
But, Lord, such happiness and satisfaction, which was due to blows and wounds, does not conduce to dispassion, detachment, cessation, peace, higher knowledge, enlightenment, Nibbana. 
But that happiness and satisfaction that is obtained by hearing the Dhamma from the Blessed Lord, which is not due to blows and wounds, does conduce to dispassion, detachment, cessation, peace, higher knowledge, enlightenment, Nibbāna.′ 
^n369 ‘And, Ruler of the Gods, what things do you call to mind when you admit to experiencing such satisfaction and happiness as this?’
 ‘Lord, at such a time, six things come to mind at which I rejoice:
“I who merely as a god exist, 
have gained 
The chance, by kamma, 
of another earthly life.′′^f357 
That, Lord, is the first thing 
that occurs to me. 
“Leaving this non-human realm of gods behind, 
Unerringly I’ll seek the womb 
I wish to find.”
That, Lord, is the second thing...
“My problems solved, 
I’ll gladly live by Buddha’s law, 
Controlled and mindful, 
and with clear awareness filled.′′ 
That, Lord, is the third thing...
“And should thereby 
enlightenment arise in me, 
As one-who-knows 
I’ll dwell, and there await my end.”
That, Lord, is the fourth thing...
“Then when I leave 
the human world again, 
I’ll be Once more a god, 
and one of highest rank.”
That, Lord, is the fifth thing...
“More glorious than devas are the 
Peerless Gods,^f358 
Among whom dwelling 
I shall make my final home.” 
That, Lord, is the sixth thing that occurs to me, 
and these are the six things at which I rejoice.
^n370 ‘Long I wandered, unfulfilled, 
in doubt, 
In quest of 
the Tathagata. 
I thought Hermits 
who live secluded and austere 
Must surely be enlightened: 
I’ll seek them. 
“What must I do to gain success, and what 
Course but leads to failure?” 
— but, thus asked, 
They could not tell me how to tread the path. 
Instead, when they found out that 
I am king Of gods, they asked me 
why I’d come to them, 
And I it was who taught them 
what I knew Of Dhamma, 
and at that, rejoicing, 
they Cried: 
“It’s Vasava, the Lord, we’ve seen!” 
But now - I’ve seen the Buddha, 
and my doubts Are all dispelled, 
my fears are allayed, 
And now to the Enlightened One I pay Homage due, 
to him who’s drawn the dart Of craving, 
to the Buddha, peerless Lord, 
Mighty hero, 
kinsman of the Sun!^f359
 Just as Brahmā’s worshipped 
by the gods, 
So likewise today 
we worship you, 
Enlightened One, and 
Teacher unsurpassed, 
Whom none can equal in the human world, 
Or in the heavens, dwelling of the gods!’
^n371 Then Sakka, ruler of the gods, said to Pañcasikha of the gandhabbas: 
‘My dear Pañcasikha, you have been of great help to me for gaining the ear of the Blessed Lord. 
For it was through your gaining his ear that we were admitted to the presence of the Blessed Lord, the Arahant, the supremely enlightened Buddha. 
I will be a father to you, you shall be king of the gandhabbas, and I will give you Bhaddā Suriyavaccasā, whom you desired.’ 
And then Sakka, ruler of the gods, touched the earth with his hand and called out three times:
′Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the supremely enlightened Buddha!
Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the supremely enlightened Buddha!
Homage to the Blessed One, the Arahant, the supremely enlightened Buddha!’
And while he had been speaking in this dialogue,^f360 the pure and spotless Dhamma-Eye arose within Sakka, ruler of the gods, and he knew: 
‘Whatever things have an origin must come to cessation.’ 
And the same thing happened to eighty thousand devas as well.
 Such were the questions which Sakka, ruler of the gods, was desirous to ask,^f361 and which the Lord answered for him. 
Therefore this discourse is called ‘Sakka’s Questions.’

^ck#d22(^z1[Mahāsatipaṭṭhāna Sutta: The Greater Discourse on the Foundations of Mindfulness] )^n372 THUS HAVE I HEARD.^f362 
Once the Lord was staying among the Kurus. There is a market-town of theirs called Kammāsadhamma.^f363
 And there the Lord addressed the monks: 
‘Monks!’ 
‘Lord’, they replied, 
and the Lord said:
^n373 ‘There is, monks, this one way^f364 to the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and distress, for the disappearance of pain and sadness,^f365 for the gaining of the right path,^f366 for the realisation of Nibbāna: - that is to say the four foundations of mindfulness.^f367
‘What are the four? 
Here, monks, a monk^f368 abides contemplating body as body,^f369 ardent, clearly aware and mindful, having put aside hankering and fretting for the world;^f370 
he abides contemplating feelings as feelings^f371 ... ; 
he abides contemplating mind as mind^f372... ; 
he abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects,^f373 ardent, clearly aware and mindful, having put aside hankering and fretting for the world.’

^n374  (1. ^z1[Mindfulness of Breathing]) ‘And how, monks, does a monk abide contemplating the body as body? 
Here a monk, having gone into the forest, or to the root of a tree, or to an empty place,^f374 sits down cross-legged, holding his body erect, having established mindfulness before him.^f375 
Mindfully he breathes in, mindfully he breathes out.^f376 
Breathing in a long breath, he knows that he breathes in a long breath,^f377 and breathing out a long breath, he knows that he breathes out a long breath. 
Breathing in a short breath, he knows that he breathes in a short breath, and breathing out a short breath, he knows that he breathes out a short breath. 
He trains himself, thinking: “I will breathe in, conscious of the whole body.”^f378 He trains himself, thinking: “I will breathe out, conscious of the whole body.” 
He trains himself, thinking: “I will breathe in, calming the whole bodily process.”^f379 He trains himself, thinking: “I will breathe out, calming the whole bodily process.” 
Just as a skilled turner, or his assistant, in making a long turn, knows that he is making a long turn, or in making a short turn, knows that he is making a short turn, 
so too a monk, in breathing in a long breath, knows that he breathes in a long breath... 
and so trains himself, thinking: “I will breathe out, calming the whole bodily process.”’ (INSIGHT) 
‘So he abides contemplating body as body internally,^f380 contemplating body as body externally, contemplating body as body both internally and externally. 
He abides contemplating arising phenomena^f381 in the body, he abides contemplating vanishing phenomena^f382 in the body, he abides contemplating both arising and vanishing phenomena in the body. 
Or else, mindfulness that “there is body” is present to him just to the extent necessary for knowledge and awareness.^f383 And he abides independent, not clinging to anything in the world. 
And that, monks, is how a monk abides contemplating body as body.’

 (2. ^z1[The Four Postures]) ^n375  (2. ^z1[The Four Postures]) ‘Again, a monk, when walking, knows that he is walking, when standing, knows that he is standing, when sitting, knows that he is sitting, when lying down, knows that he is lying down.

 (3. ^z1[Clear Awareness]) ^n376  (3. ^z1[Clear Awareness]) ‘Again, a monk, when going forward or back, is clearly aware of what he is doing,^f384 in looking forward or back he is clearly aware of what he is doing, in bending and stretching he is clearly aware of what he is doing, in carrying his inner and outer robe and his bowl he is clearly aware of what he is doing, in eating, drinking, chewing and savouring he is clearly aware of what he is doing, in passing excrement or urine he is clearly aware of what he is doing, in walking, standing, sitting, falling asleep and waking up, in speaking or in staying silent, he is clearly aware of what he is doing.

Here, whoever has unwanted, disliked, unpleasant sight-objects, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles or mind-objects, or whoever encounters ill-wishers, wishers of harm, of discomfort, of insecurity, with whom they have concourse, intercourse, connection, union, 
that, monks, is called being attached to the unloved.
^n397 ‘And what is being separated from the loved? 
Here, whoever has what is wanted, liked, pleasant sight-objects, sounds, smells, tastes, tangibles or mind-objects, or whoever encounters well-wishers, wishers of good, of comfort, of security, mother or father or brother or sister or younger kinsmen or friends or colleagues or blood-relations, and then is deprived of such concourse, intercourse, connection, or union, 
that, monks, is called being separated from the loved. 
^n398 ‘And what is not getting what one wants? 
In beings subject to birth, monks, this wish arises: 
“Oh that we were not subject to birth, that we might not come to birth!” 
But this cannot be gained by wishing. 
That is not getting what one wants. 
In beings subject to ageing, to disease,^f437 to death, to sorrow, lamentation, pain, sadness and distress this wish arises: 
“Oh that we were not subject to ageing... 





distress, that we might not come to these things!” 
But this cannot be gained by wishing. 
That is not getting what one wants.
^n399 ‘And how, monks, in short, are the five aggregates of grasping suffering? 
They are as follows: the aggregate of grasping that is form, the aggregate of grasping that is feeling, the aggregate of grasping that is perception, the aggregate of grasping that is the mental formations, the aggregate of grasping that is consciousness,^f438 
These are, in short, the five aggregates of grasping that are suffering. 
And that, monks, is called the Noble Truth of Suffering. 
^n400 ‘And what, monks, is the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering? 
It is that craving^f439 which gives rise to rebirth,^f440 bound up with pleasure and lust, finding fresh delight now here, now there: 
that is to say sensual craving, craving for existence, and craving for non-existence.^f441
‘And where does this craving arise and establish itself? 
Wherever in the world there is anything agreeable and pleasurable, there this craving arises and establishes itself.
‘And what is there in the world that is agreeable and pleasurable? 
The eye in the world is agreeable and pleasurable, 
the ear...,
 the nose..., 
the tongue..., 
the body..., 
the mind in the world is agreeable and pleasurable, and there this craving arises and establishes itself. 
Sights,

‘Feeling born of eye-contact,

‘Volition in regard to sights,

‘The craving for sights,

′Thinking^f443 of sights,

′Pondering^f444 on sights, 
sounds, 
smells, 
tastes, 
tangibles 
and mind-objects in the world is agreeable and pleasurable, and there this craving arises and establishes itself. 
And that, monks, is called the Noble Truth of the Origin of Suffering.
^n401 ‘And what, monks, is the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering? 
It is the complete fading-away and extinction of this craving, its forsaking and abandonment, liberation from it, detachment from it.^f445
 And how does this craving come to be abandoned, how does its cessation come about?
‘Wherever in the world there is anything agreeable and pleasurable, there its cessation comes about. 
And what is there in the world that is agreeable and pleasurable?
‘The eye in the world is agreeable and pleasurable, 
the ear ..., 
the nose..., 
the tongue...,

the mind in the world is agreeable and pleasurable, and there this craving comes to be abandoned, there its cessation comes about:






‘Eye-consciousness, 
ear-consciousness, 
nose-consciousness, 
tongue-consciousness, 
body-consciousness, 
mind-consciousness in the world is agreeable and pleasurable, and there this craving comes to be abandoned, there its cessation comes about.
‘Sights,

And that, monks, is called the Noble Truth of the Cessation of Suffering.
^n402 ‘And what, monks, is the Noble Truth of the Way of Practice Leading to the Cessation of Suffering? 
It is just this Noble Eightfold Path, namely: — 
Right View, Right Thought; Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood; Right Effort Right Mindfulness, Right Concentration. 
‘And what, monks, is Right View?^f446 
It is, monks, the knowledge of suffering, the knowledge of the origin of suffering, the knowledge of the cessation of suffering, and the knowledge of the way of practice leading to the cessation of suffering. 
This is called Right View. 
‘And what, monks, is Right Thought?^f447 
The thought of renunciation, the thought of non-ill-will, the thought of harmlessness. 
This, monks, is called Right Thought. 
‘And what, monks, is Right Speech? 
Refraining from lying, refraining from slander, refraining from harsh speech, refraining from frivolous speech. 
This is called Right Speech.
‘And what, monks, is Right Action? 
Refraining from taking life, refraining from taking what is not given, refraining from sexual misconduct. 
This is called Right Action.
‘And what, monks, is Right Livelihood? 
Here, monks, the Ariyan disciple, having given up wrong livelihood, keeps himself by right livelihood.

‘And what, monks, is Right Effort? 
Here, monks, a monk rouses his will, makes an effort, stirs up energy, exerts his mind and strives to prevent the arising of unarisen evil unwholesome mental states. 
He rouses his will... and strives to overcome evil unwholesome mental states that have arisen. 
He rouses his will... and strives to produce unarisen wholesome mental states. 
He rouses his will, makes an effort, stirs up energy, exerts his mind and strives to maintain wholesome mental states that have arisen, not to let them fade away, to bring them to greater growth, to the full perfection of development. 
This is called Right Effort.
‘And what, monks, is Right Mindfulness? 
Here, monks, a monk abides contemplating body as body, ardent, clearly aware and mindful, having put aside hankering and fretting for the world; 
he abides contemplating feelings as feelings...; 
he abides contemplating mind as mind...; 
he abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects, ardent, clearly aware and mindful, having put aside hankering and fretting for the world. 
This is called Right Mindfulness.
‘And what, monks, is Right Concentration? 
Here, a monk, detached from sense-desires, detached from unwholesome mental states, enters and remains in the first jhāna, which is with thinking and pondering, born of detachment, filled with delight and joy. 
And with the subsiding of thinking and pondering, by gaining inner tranquillity and oneness of mind, he enters and remains in the second jhāna, which is without thinking and pondering, born of concentration, filled with delight and joy. 
And with the fading away of delight, remaining imperturbable, mindful and clearly aware, he experiences in himself the joy of which the Noble Ones say: “Happy is he who dwells with equanimity and mindfulness”, he enters the third jhāna. 
And, having given up pleasure and pain, and with the disappearance of former gladness and sadness, he enters and remains in the fourth jhāna, which is beyond pleasure and pain, and purified by equanimity and mindfulness. 
This is called Right Concentration. 
And that, monks, is called the way of practice leading to the cessation of suffering.’ (INSIGHT) 
^n403 ‘So he abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects internally, contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects externally, contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects both internally and externally. 
He abides contemplating arising phenomena in mind-objects, he abides contemplating vanishing-phenomena in mind-objects, he abides contemplating both arising and vanishing phenomena in mind-objects. 
Or else, mindfulness that “there are mind-objects” is present just to the extent necessary for knowledge and awareness. And he abides detached, not grasping at anything in the world. 
And that, monks, is how a monk abides contemplating mind-objects as mind-objects in respect of the Four Noble Truths.’ 

(CONCLUSION) 
^n404 ‘Whoever, monks, should practise these four foundations of mindfulness for just seven years may expect one of two results: 
either Arahantship in this life or, if there should be some substrate left, the state of a Non-Returner. 
Let alone seven years — 
whoever should practise them for just six years ..., 
five years..., 
four years... 
three years..., 
two years..., 
one year may expect one of two results...; 
let alone one year — 
whoever should practise them for just seven months..., 


six months..., 
five months . . . , 
four months..., 
three months..., 
two months..., 
one month..., 
half a month may expect one of two results...; 
let alone half a month — 
whoever should practise these four foundations of mindfulness for just one week may expect one of two results: 
either Arahantship in this life or, if there should be some substrate left, the state of a Non-Returner.‘
^n405 It was said: “There is, monks, this one way to the purification of beings, for the overcoming of sorrow and distress, for the disappearance of pain and sadness, for the gaining of the right path, for the realisation of Nibbāna: — that is to say the four foundations of mindfulness”, 
and it is for this reason that it was said.’
 Thus the Lord spoke, 
and the monks rejoiced and were delighted at his words.

^ck#d23(^z1[Payasi Sutta: About Payasi] ^h[Debate with a Sceptic] )^n406 THUS HAVE I HEARD. 
Once the Venerable Kumāra-Kassapa ^f374 was touring round Kosala with a large company of about five hundred monks, and he came to stay at a town called Setavya. 
He stayed to the north of Setavya in the Siṁsapā Forest.^f375
 And at that time Prince Payasi was living at Setavya, a populous place, full of grass, timber, water and corn, which had been given to him by King Pasenadi of Kosala as a royal gift and with royal powers.^f376
^n407 And Prince Payasi developed the following evil opinion: 
‘There is no other world, there are no spontaneously born beings, there is no fruit or result of good or evil deeds.′^f377 
Meanwhile, the Brahmins and householders of Setavya heard the news: 
‘The ascetic Kumāra-Kassapa, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, is touring round Kosala with a large company of about five hundred monks; he has arrived at Setavya and is staying to the north of Setavya in the Simsapā Forest; 
and concerning the Reverend Kassapa a good report has been spread about: 
“He is learned, experienced, wise, well-informed, a fine speaker, able to give good replies, venerable, an Arahant.” 
And it is good to see such Arahants.’ 
And so the Brahmins and householders of Setavya, leaving Setavya by the north gate in large numbers, made for the Simsapā Forest.
^n408 And just then, Prince Payasi had gone up to the verandah for his midday rest. 
Seeing all the Brahmins and householders making for the Simsapa Forest, he asked his steward why. 
The steward said: 
‘Sir, it is the ascetic Kumāra-Kassapa, a disciple of the ascetic Gotama, ... 

and concerning him a good report has been spread about... 

That is why they are going to see him.’ 
‘Well then, steward, you go to the Brahmins and householders of Setavya and say: 
“Gentlemen, Prince Payasi says: 
‘Please wait, the Prince will come to see the ascetic Kumara-Kassapa.’” 
Already this ascetic Kumāra-Kassapa has been teaching these foolish and inexperienced Brahmins and householders of Setavya that 
there is another world, that there are spontaneously born beings, and that there is fruit and result of good and evil deeds. 
But no such things exist.’ 
‘Very good, sir’, said the steward, and delivered the message.

^n409 Then Prince Payasi, accompanied by the Brahmins and householders of Setavya, went to the Simsapa Forest where the Venerable Kumāra-Kassapa was. Having exchanged courtesies with the Venerable Kumara Kassapa, he sat down to one side. 
And some of the Brahmins and householders saluted the Venerable Kumāra-Kassapa and then sat down to one side, while some first exchanged courtesies with him, some saluted him with joined palms, some announced their name and clan, and some silently sat down to one side.





^n410 Then Price Payasi said to the Venerable Kumāra-Kassapa: 
‘Reverend Kassapa, I hold to this tenet and this view: 
There is no other world, there are no spontaneously born beings, there is no fruit or result of good or evil deeds.’ 
‘Well, Prince, I have never seen or heard of such a tenet or view 
as you declare. 

^n411  And so, Prince, I will question you about it, and you shall reply as you think fit. 
What do you think, Prince? 
‘Reverend Kassapa, they are in another world, and they are gods, not humans.’ 
‘In the same way, Prince, you should consider: “There is another world, there are spontaneously born beings, there is fruit and result of good and evil deeds.′′′ 


^n412 ‘Whatever you may say about that, Reverend Kassapa, 
I still think there is no other world...’ 
′Have you any reasons for this assertion, Prince?’ 

‘I have, Reverend Kassapa.’ 

′How is that, Prince?’
‘Reverend Kassapa, I have friends, colleagues and blood-relations who take life, take what is not given, commit sexual offences, tell lies, use abusive, harsh and frivolous speech, who are greedy, full of hatred and hold wrong views. 
Eventually they become ill, suffering, diseased. 
And when 
I am sure they will not recover, I go to them and say: 
“There are certain ascetics and Brahmins who declare and believe that those who take life, ... 
hold wrong views will, after death at the breaking-up of the body, be born in a state of woe, an evil place, a place of punishment, in hell. 
Now you have done these things, and if what these ascetics and Brahmins say is true, that is where you will go. 
Now if, after death, you go to a state of woe, ... 
come to me and declare that 
there is another world, there are spontaneously born beings, there is fruit and result of good and evil deeds. 
You, gentlemen, are trustworthy and dependable, and what you have seen shall be as if I had seen it myself, so it will be.” 
But although they agreed, they neither came to tell me, nor did they send a messenger. 
That, Reverend Kassapa, is my reason for maintaining: 
“There is no other world, there are no spontaneously born beings, there is no fruit or result of good or evil deeds.”’
^n413 ‘As to that, Prince, I will question you about it, and you shall reply as you think fit. 
What do you think, Prince? 
Suppose they were to bring a thief before you caught in the act, and say: 
“This man, Lord, is a thief caught in the act. 
Sentence him to any punishment you wish.” 
And you might say: 
“Bind this man’s arms tightly behind him with a strong rope, shave his head closely, and lead him to the rough sound of a drum through the streets and squares and out through the southern gate, and there cut off his head.” 
And they, saying: “Very good” in assent, might... lead him out through the southern gate, and there cut off his head.” 
Now if that thief were to say to the executioners: 
”Good executioners, in this town or village I have friends, colleagues and blood-relations, please wait till I have visited them”, would he get his wish? 
Or would they just cut off that talkative thief’s head?’ 
′He would not get his wish, Reverend Kassapa. 
They would just cut off his head.’
‘So, Prince, this thief could not get even his human executioners to wait while he visited his friends and relations. 

So how can your friends, colleagues and blood-relations who have committed all these misdeeds, having died and gone to a place of woe, prevail upon the warders of hell, saying: 
“Good warders of hell, please wait while we report to Prince Payasi that 
there is another world, there are spontaneously born beings, and there is fruit and result of good and evil deeds”? 
Therefore, Prince, admit that there is another world...’

^n414 ‘Whatever you may say about that, Reverend Kassapa, I still think 
there is no other world...’ 
′Have you any reason for this assertion, Prince?’ 

‘I have, Reverend Kassapa.’ 

‘What is that, Prince?’
‘Reverend Kassapa, I have friends ... who abstain from taking life, from taking what is not given, from committing sexual offences, from telling lies or using abusive, harsh and frivolous speech, who are not greedy or full of hatred and who have right views.^f378
 Eventually they become ill... 

and when I am sure they will not recover, I go to them and say: 
“There are certain ascetics and Brahmins who declare and believe that 
those who abstain from taking life ... and have right views will, after death at the breaking-up of the body, be born in a happy state, a heavenly world. 
Now you have refrained from doing these things, 
and if what these ascetics and Brahmins say is true, that is where you will go. 
Now if, after death, you go to a happy state, a heavenly world, come to me and declare that 
there is another world...
You, gentlemen, are trustworthy and dependable, and what you have seen shall be as if I had seen it myself, so it will be.” 
But although they agreed, they neither came to me, nor did they send a messenger. 
That, Reverend Kassapa, is my reason for maintaining: 
“There is no other world...′′′ 
^n415 ‘Well then, Prince, I will give you a parable, because some wise people understand what is said by means of parables. 
Suppose a man had fallen head first into a cesspit, and you were to say to your men: 
“Pull that man out of the cesspit! ” 
and they would say: 
“Very good”
, and do so. 
Then you would tell them to 
clean his body thoroughly of the filth with bamboo scrapers, 


and then to give him a triple shampoo with yellow loam. 

Then you would tell them to 
anoint his body with oil and then to clean him three times with fine soap-powder. 

Then you would tell them to 
dress his hair and beard, and to adorn him with fine garlands, ointments and clothes. 
1325〕 
Finally you would tell them to 
lead him up to your palace and let him indulge in the pleasures of the five senses, 



and they would do so. 
What do you think, Prince? 
Would that man, having been well washed, with his hair and beard dressed, adorned and garlanded, clothed in white, and having been conveyed up to the palace, enjoying and revelling in the pleasures of the five senses, want to be plunged once more into that cesspit?’ 
‘No, Reverend Kassapa.’ 
‘Why not?’ 
‘Because that cesspit is unclean and considered so, evil-smelling, horrible, revolting, and generally considered to be so.’
′In just the same way, Prince, human beings are unclean, evil-smelling, horrible, revolting and generally considered to be so by the devas. 
So why should your friends ... 
who have not committed any of the offences... (as verse 8), and who have after death been born in a happy state, a heavenly world, come back and say: 
“There is another world,...
there is fruit of good and evil deeds”? 
Therefore, Prince, admit that there is another world...’
^n416 ‘Whatever you may say about that, Reverend Kassapa, I still think 
there is no other world...’ 
‘Have you any reason for this assertion, Prince?’ 
‘I have, Reverend Kassapa.’ 
‘What is that, Prince?’
‘Reverend Kassapa, I have friends who abstain ... from telling lies, from strong drink and sloth-inducing drugs. 


Eventually they become ill... 
“There are certain ascetics and Brahmins who declare and believe that 
those who abstain from taking life...

and sloth-producing drugs will...be born in a happy state, in a heavenly world, as companions of the Thirty-Three Gods... 



′′But although they agreed, they neither came to tell me, nor did they send a messenger. 
That, Reverend Kassapa, is my reason for maintaining: 
”There is no other world...′′′ 
^n417 ‘As to that, Prince, I will question you about it, and you shall answer as you think fit. 
That which is for human beings, Prince, a hundred years is for the Thirty-Three Gods one day and night. 
Thirty of such nights make a month, twelve such months a year, and a thousand such years are the life-span of the Thirty-Three Gods. 
Now suppose they were to think: 
“After we have indulged in the pleasures of the five senses for two or three days we will go to Pāyāsi and tell him 
there is another world, 
there are spontaneously born beings, 
there is fruit and result of good and evil deeds”, would they have done so?’ 
‘No, Reverend Kassapa, 
because we should be long-since dead. 
But, Reverend Kassapa, who has told you that 
the Thirty-Three Gods exist, and that they are so long-lived? 
I don’t believe the Thirty-Three Gods exist or are so long-lived.’

^n418 ‘Prince, imagine a man who was blind from birth and could not see dark or light objects, or blue, yellow, red or crimson ones, could not see the smooth and the rough, could not see the stars and the moon. 
He might say: 
“There are no dark and light objects and nobody who can see them, ... 






there is no sun or moon, 
and nobody who can see them. 
Would he be speaking rightly, Prince?’ 
‘No, Reverend Kassapa. 
There are dark and light objects . . . ,



there is a sun and a moon, 
and anyone who said: “I am not aware of this thing, I cannot see it, and therefore it does not exist” 
would not be speaking rightly.’
‘Well, Prince, it appears that your reply is like that of the blind man when you ask how I know about the 

Thirty-Three Gods and their longevity. 


Prince, the other world cannot be seen the way you think, with the physical eye. 
Prince, those ascetics and Brahmins who seek in the jungle-thickets and the recesses of the forest for a resting-place that is quiet, with little noise — they stay there unwearied, ardent, restrained, purifying the divine eye,^f379 
and with that purified divine eye that exceeds the powers of human sight, they see both this world and the next, and spontaneously born beings. 
That, Prince, is how the other world can be seen, 
and not the way you think, with the physical eye. 
Therefore, Prince, admit that there is another world, 
that there are spontaneously born beings, and that there is fruit and result of good and evil deeds.’
^n419 ‘Whatever you may say about that, Reverend Kassapa, I still think 
there is no other world...’ 
‘Have you any reason for this assertion, Prince?’ 
‘I have, Reverend Kassapa.’ 
‘What is that, Prince?’
‘Well, Reverend Kassapa, I see here some ascetics and Brahmins who observe morality and are well-conducted, who want to live, do not want to die, who desire comfort and hate suffering. 
And it seems to me that 
if these good ascetics and Brahmins who are 
so moral and well-conducted know that after death they will be better off, 
then these good people would now take poison, take a knife and kill themselves, hang themselves or jump off a cliff. 
But though they have such knowledge, 
they still want to live, do not want to die, they desire comfort and hate suffering. 
And that, Reverend Kassapa, is my reason for maintaining: 
“There is no other world. . .”’
^n420 ‘Well then, Prince, I will give you a parable, 
because some wise people understand what is said by means of parables. 
Once upon a time, Prince, a certain Brahmin had two wives. 
One had a son ten or twelve years old, while the other was pregnant 
and nearing her time when the Brahmin died. 
Then this youth said to his mother’s co-wife: 
“Lady, whatever wealth and possessions, silver or gold, 
there may be, is all mine. 
My father made me his heir.” 
At this the Brahmin lady said to the youth: 
“Wait, young man, until I give birth. 
If the child is a boy, one portion will be his, 
and if it is a girl, she will become your servant.” 
The youth repeated his words a second time, and received the same reply. 







When he repeated them a third time, 



the lady took a knife and, going into an inner room, cut open her belly, thinking: 
“If only I could find out whether it is a boy or a girl!” 
And thus she destroyed herself and the living embryo, and the wealth as well, 
just as fools do who seek their inheritance unwisely, heedless of hidden danger.‘In the same way you, Prince, will foolishly enter on hidden dangers by unwisely seeking for another world, 
just as that Brahmin lady did in seeking her inheritance. 
But, Prince, those ascetics and Brahmins who observe morality and are well-conducted do not seek to hasten the ripening of that which is not yet ripe, 
but rather they wisely await its ripening. 
Their life is profitable to those ascetics and Brahmins, 
for the longer such moral and well-conducted ascetics and Brahmins remain alive, the greater the merit that they create; they practise for the welfare of the many, for the happiness of the many, out of compassion for the world, for the profit and benefit of devas and humans. 
Therefore, Prince, admit that there is another world...’

^n421 ‘Whatever you may say about that, Reverend Kassapa, I still think there is 
no other world...’ 
′Have you any reason for this assertion, Prince?’ 
‘I have, Reverend Kassapa.’ 
‘What is that, Prince?’
‘Reverend Kassapa, take the case that they bring a thief before me, caught in the act and say: 
“Here, Lord, is a thief caught in the act, 
sentence him to whatever punishment you wish.” 
And I say: 
“Take this man and put him alive in a jar. Seal the mouth and close it with a damp skin, give it a thick covering of damp clay, put it in an oven and light the fire.” 
And they do so. 
When we are sure the man is dead, we remove the jar, break the clay, uncover the mouth, and watch carefully: 
“Maybe we can see his soul^f380 escaping.” 
But we do not see any soul escaping, 
and that is why, Reverend Kassapa, 
I believe there is no other world...’
^n422 ‘As to that, Prince, I will question you about it, and you shall reply as you think fit. 
Do you admit that when you have gone for your midday rest you have seen pleasant visions of parks, forests, delightful country and lotus-ponds?’ 
′I do, Reverend Kassapa.’ 
‘And at that time are you not watched over by hunchbacks, dwarfs, young girls and maidens?’ 
‘I am, Reverend Kassapa.’ 
‘And do they observe your soul entering or leaving your body?’ 
‘No, Reverend Kassapa.’ 
‘So they do not see your soul entering or leaving your body even when you are alive. 
Therefore how could you see the soul of a dead man entering or leaving his body? 
Therefore, Prince, admit that 
there is another world...’
^n423 ‘Whatever you may say about that, Reverend Kassapa, I still think there is 
no other world...’ 
‘Have you any reason for this assertion, Prince?’ 
‘I have, Reverend Kassapa.’ 
‘What is that, Prince?’
‘Reverend Kassapa, take the case that they bring a thief before me... 


and I say: 
“Weigh this man on the scales alive, then strangle him, and weigh him again.” 
And they do so. 
As long as he was alive, he was lighter, softer and more flexible, 
but when he was dead he was heavier, stiffer^f381 and more inflexible. 
And that, Reverend Kassapa, is my reason for maintaining that there is 
no other world...’
^n424 ‘Well then, Prince, I will give you a parable... 

Suppose a man weighed an iron ball that had been heated all day, blazing, burning fiercely, glowing. 
And suppose that after a time, when it had grown cold and gone out, he weighed it again. At which time would it be lighter, softer and more flexible: 
when it was hot, burning and glowing, or when it was cold and extinguished?’ 
‘Reverend Kassapa, when that ball of iron is hot, burning and glowing with the elements of fire and air, then it is lighter, softer and more flexible. 
When, without those elements,^f382 it has grown cold and gone out, it is heavier, stiffer and more inflexible.’ 
‘Well then, Prince, it is just the same with the body. When it has life, heat and consciousness, it is lighter, softer and more flexible. 
But when it is deprived of life, heat and consciousness, it is heavier, stiffer and more inflexible. 
In the same way, Prince, you should consider:
 “There is another world...′′′ 
^n425 ‘Whatever you may say about that, Reverend Kassapa, I still think there is 
no other world...’ 
′Have you any reason for this assertion, Prince?’ 
‘I have, Reverend Kassapa.’ 
‘What is that, Prince?’
‘Reverend Kassapa, take the case of a thief that they bring before me... 


and I say: 
“Kill this man without wounding his cuticle, skin, flesh, sinews, bones or marrow′′,^f383 and they do so. 
When he is half-dead, I say: 
“Now lay this man on his back, 
and perhaps we shall be able to see his soul emerging.” 
They do so, 
but we cannot see his soul emerging. 
Then I say: 
“Turn him face downwards,...
on his side, . . . 
on the other side,...
stand him up,...
stand him on his head,...
thump him with your fists,...
stone him,...
hit him with sticks,... 
strike him with swords,... 
shake him this way and that, and perhaps we shall be able to see his soul emerging.” 
And they do all these things, 

but although he has eyes he does not perceive objects or their spheres,^f384 
although he has ears he does not hear sounds..., 
although he has a nose he does not smell smells..., 
although he has a tongue he does not taste tastes..., 
although he has a body he does not feel tangibles or their spheres. 
And that is why, Reverend Kassapa, I believe there is 
no other world...’
^n426 ‘Well then, Prince, I will give you a parable... 

Once there was a trumpeter who took his trumpet^f385 and went into the border country.^f386 
On coming to a village, he stood in the village centre, blew his trumpet three times and then, putting it down on the ground, sat down to one side. 
Then, Prince, those border folk thought: 
“Where does that sound come from that is so delightful, so sweet, so intoxicating, so compelling, so captivating?” 
They addressed the trumpeter and asked him about this. 

“Friends, this trumpet is where those delightful sounds come from.”
 So then they laid the trumpet on its back, crying: 
“Speak, mister trumpet, speak!” 
But the trumpet never uttered a sound. 
Then they turned it face downwards,...on its side,... on its other side,... stood it up,... stood it on its head, . . . thumped it with their fists,... stoned it,... beat it with sticks,... struck it with swords,... shook it this way and that, crying: 
“Speak, mister trumpet, speak!” 
But the trumpet never uttered a sound. 
The trumpeter thought: 
“What fools these border folk are! How stupidly they search for the sound of the trumpet!” 
And as they watched him, he took the trumpet, blew it three times, and went away. 
And those border folk thought: 
“It seems that when the trumpet is accompanied by a man, by effort, and by the wind, then it makes a sound. But when it is not accompanied by a man, by effort, and by the wind, then it makes no sound.”
‘In the same way, Prince, when this body has life, heat and consciousness, then it goes and comes back, stands and sits and lies down, sees things with its eyes, hears with its ears, smells with its nose, tastes with its tongue, feels with its body, and knows mental objects with its mind. 
But when it has no life, heat or consciousness, it does none of these things. 
In the same way, Prince, you should consider: 
“There is another world...′′′ 
^n427 ‘Whatever you may say about that, Reverend Kassapa, I still think there is 
no other world...’ 
′Have you any reason for this assertion, Prince?’ 
‘I have, Reverend Kassapa.’ 
‘What is that, Prince?’
‘Reverend Kassapa, take the case of a thief they bring before me...


and I say: 
“Strip away this man’s outer skin, and perhaps we shall be able to see his soul emerging.” 



Then I tell them to strip away his inner skin, his flesh, sinews, bones, bone-marrow... 
but still we cannot see any soul emerging. 
And that is why, Reverend Kassapa, I believe there is 
no other world...’
^n428 ‘Well then, Prince, I will give you a parable... 

Once there was a matted-haired fire-worshipper^f387 who dwelt in the forest in a leaf-hut. 
And a certain tribe was on the move, 
and its leader stayed for one night near the fire-worshipper’s dwelling, and then left. 
So the fire-worshipper thought 
he would go to the site to see if he could find anything he could make use of. 
He got up early and went to the site, and there he saw a tiny delicate baby boy lying abandoned on his back. 
At the sight he thought: 
“It would not be right for me to look on and let a human being die. 
I had better take this child to my hermitage, take care of him, feed him and bring him up.” 
So he did so. 
When the boy was ten or twelve, the hermit had some business to do in the neighbourhood. 
So he said to the boy: 
“I want to go to the neighbourhood, my son. 
You look after the fire 
and don′t let it go out. 
If it should go out, here is an axe, here are some sticks, here are the fire-sticks, so you can relight the fire and look after it.” 
Having thus instructed the boy, the hermit went into the neighbourhood. 
But the boy, being absorbed in his games, let the fire go out. 
Then he thought: 
“Father said: ′... 
here is an axe ... 

so you can relight the fire and look after it.’ 
Now I’d better do so!” 
So he chopped up the fire-sticks with the axe, thinking: 
“I expect I’ll get a fire this way.” 
But he got no fire. 
He cut the fire-sticks into two, into three, into four, into five, ten, a hundred pieces, he splintered them, he pounded them in a mortar, he winnowed them in a great wind, thinking: 
“I expect I’ll get a fire this way.” 
But he got no fire, 
and when the hermit came back, having finished his business, he said: 
“Son, why have you let the fire go out?” 
and the boy told him what had happened. 











The hermit thought: 
“How stupid this boy is, how senseless! What a thoughtless way to try to get a fire!′′ 
So, while the boy looked on, he took the fire-sticks and rekindled the fire, saying : 
”Son, that’s the way to rekindle a fire, 
not the stupid, senseless, thoughtless way you tried to do it!”
′In just the same way, Prince, you are looking foolishly, senselessly and unreasonably for another world. 
Prince, give up this evil viewpoint, give it up! 
Do not let it cause you misfortune and suffering for a long time!’
^n429 ‘Even though you say this, Reverend Kassapa, still I cannot bear to give up this evil opinion. 
King Pasenadi of Kosala knows my opinions, and so do kings abroad. 


If I give it up, they will say: 
′′What a fool Prince Pāyāsi is, how stupidly he grasps at wrong views!” 
I will stick to this view out of anger, contempt and spite!’
^n430 ‘Well then, Prince, I will give you a parable...

Once, Prince, a great caravan of a thousand carts was travelling from east to west. 
And wherever they went, they rapidly consumed all the grass, wood and greenstuff. 
Now this caravan had two leaders, each in charge of five hundred carts. 
And they thought: 
“This is a great caravan of a thousand carts. 
Wherever we go we use up all the supplies. 

Perhaps we should divide the caravan into two groups of five hundred carts each”
, and they did so. 
Then one of the leaders collected plenty of grass, wood and water, and set off. 
After two or three days’ journey he saw a dark red-eyed man coming towards him wearing a quiver and a wreath of white water-lilies, with his clothes and hair all wet, driving a donkey-chariot whose wheels were splashed with mud. On seeing this man, the leader said: 
“Where do you come from, sir?” 
“From such-and-such.” 
“And where are you going?” 
“To so-and-so.” 
“Has there been much rainfall in the jungle ahead?” 
“Oh yes, sir, there has been a great deal of rain in the jungle ahead of you, the roads are well watered and there is plenty of grass, wood and water. 
Throw away the grass, wood and water you have already got, sir! You will make rapid progress with lightly-laden carts, so do not tire your draught-oxen!” 
The caravan-leader told the carters 
what the man had said: 
″Throw away the grass, wood and water...”,


 and they did so. 
But at the first camping-place they did not find any grass, wood or water, 
nor at the second, 
the third, 
fourth, 
fifth, 
sixth 
or seventh, 
and thus they all came to ruin and destruction. 
And whatever there was of them, men and cattle, they were all gobbled up by that yakkha-spirit, ^f388 
and only their bones remained.^f389
‘And when the leader of the second caravan was sure 
the first caravan had gone forward far enough, he stocked up with plenty of grass, wood and water. 
Aftr two or three days’ journey this leader saw a dark red-eyed man coming towards him... 










who advised him to throw away his stocks of grass, wood and water. Then the leader said to the carters: 
“This man told us that we should throw away the grass, wood and water we already have. 
But he is not one of our friends and relatives, so why should we trust him? 
So do not throw away the grass, wood and water we have; 
let the caravan continue on its way with the goods we have brought, and do not throw any of them away!” The carters agreed and did as he said. 
And at the first camping-place they did not find any grass, wood or water, 
nor at the second, 
the third, 
fourth, 
fifth, 
sixth or 
seventh, 
but there they saw the other caravan that had come to ruin and destruction, 
and they saw the bones of those men and cattle that had been gobbled up by the yakkha-spirit. 
Then the caravan leader said to the carters: 
“That caravan came to ruin and destruction through the folly of its leader. 
So now let us leave behind such of our goods as are of little value, and take whatever is of greater value from the other caravan.” 
And they did so. And with that wise leader they passed safely through the jungle.
‘In the same way you, Prince, will come to ruin and destruction if you foolishly and unwisely seek the other world in the wrong way. 
Those who think they can trust anything they hear are heading for ruin and destruction just like those carters. 
Prince, give up this evil viewpoint, give it up! 
Do not let it cause you misfortune and suffering for a long time!’
^n431 ‘Even though you say this, Reverend Kassapa, still I cannot bear to give up this evil opinion... 



If I give it up, they will say: 
“What a fool Prince Pāyāsi is . . .”’
^n432 ‘Well then, Prince, I will give you a parable... 

Once there was a swineherd who was going from his own village to another. 
There he saw a heap of dry dung that had been thrown away, 
and he thought: 
“There’s a lot of dry dung somebody’s thrown away, that would be food for my pigs. 
I ought to carry it away. 
And he spread out his cloak, gathered up the dung in it, made it into a bundle and put it on his head, and went on. 
But on his way back there was a heavy shower of unseasonable rain, 
and he went on his way bespattered with oozing, dripping dung to his finger-tips, and still carrying his load of dung. 
Those who saw him said: 
“You must be mad! You must be crazy! Why do you go along carrying that load of dung that’s oozing and dripping all over you down to your finger-tips?” 
“You’re the ones that are mad! You’re the ones that are crazy! This stuff is food for my pigs.” 
Prince, you speak just like the dung-carrier in my parable. 
Prince, give up this evil viewpoint, give it up! 
Do not let it cause you misfortune and suffering for a long time!’
^n433 ‘Even though you say this, Reverend Kassapa, still I cannot bear to give up this evil opinion...




If I give it up, they will say: 
“What a fool Prince Payasi is...”’
^n434 ‘Well then, Prince, I will give you a parable...

Once there were two gamblers using nuts as dice. 
One of them, whenever he got the unlucky dice, swallowed it. 
The other noticed what he was doing, and said: 
“Well, my friend, you’re the winner all right! Give me the dice and I will make an offering of them.” 
“All right”, said the first, and gave them to him. 
Then that one filled the dice with poison and then said: 
“Come on, let’s have a game!” 
The other agreed, they played again, 
and once again the one player, 
whenever he got the unlucky dice, swallowed it. 
The second watched him do so, and then uttered this verse:
“The dice is smeared with burning stuff, 
Though the swallower doesn’t know. 
Swallow, cheat, and swallow well — 
Bitter it will be like hell!”
Prince, you speak just like the gambler in my parable. 
Prince, give up this evil viewpoint, give it up! 
Do not let it cause you misfortune and suffering for a long time!’

^n436 ‘Well then, Prince, I will give you a parable... 

Once the inhabitants of a certain neighbourhood migrated. 
And one man said to his friend: 
“Come along, let’s go to that neighbourhood, we might find something valuable!” 
His friend agreed, 
so they went to that district, and came to a village street. And there they saw a pile of hemp that had been thrown away, and one said: 
“Here’s some hemp. You make a bundle, I’ll make a bundle, and we’ll both carry it off.” 
The other agreed, and they did so. 
Then, coming to another village street, they found some hemp-thread, and one said: 
“This pile of hemp-thread is just what we wanted the hemp for. 
Let’s each throw away our bundle of hemp, and we’ll go on with a load of hemp-thread each.” 
“I’ve brought this bundle of hemp a long way and it’s well tied up. That will do for me — you do as you like!” 
So his companion threw away the hemp and took the hemp-thread.
‘Coming to another village street, 
they found some hemp-cloth, and one said: 
“This pile of hemp-cloth is just what we wanted the hemp or hemp-thread for. 
You throw away your load of hemp 
and I’ll throw away my load of hemp-thread, and we’ll go on with a load of hemp-cloth each.” 
But the other replied as before, so the one companion threw away the hemp-thread and took the hemp-cloth. 
In another village 
they saw a pile of flax..., 
in another, linen-thread..., 
in another, linen-cloth..., 
in another, cotton..., 
in another, cotton-thread..., 
in another, cotton-cloth..., 
in another, iron..., 
in another, copper..., 
in another, tin..., 
in another, lead..., 
in another, silver..., 
in another, gold. Then one said: 
“This pile of gold is just what we wanted the hemp, hemp-thread, hemp-cloth, flax, linen-thread, linen-cloth, cotton, cotton-thread, cotton-cloth, iron, copper, tin, lead, silver for. 
You throw away your load of hemp and I’ll throw away my load of silver, and we’ll both go on with a load of gold each.” 
“I’ve brought this load of hemp a long way and it’s well tied up. That will do for me — you do as you like!” 
And this companion threw away the load of silver and took the load of gold.
‘Then they came back to their own village. 
And there the one who brought a load of hemp gave no pleasure to his parents, nor to his wife and children, nor to his friends and colleagues, and he did not even get any joy or happiness from it himself. 
But the one who came back with a load of gold pleased his parents, his wife and children, his friends and colleagues, and he derived joy and happiness from it himself as well.
‘Prince, you speak just like the hemp-bearer in my parable. 
Prince, give up this evil view, give it up! 
Do not let it cause you misfortune and suffering for a long time!’
^n437 ‘I was pleased and delighted with the Reverend Kassapa’s first parable, 
and I wanted to hear his quick-witted replies to questions, because I thought he was a worthy opponent. ^f390 
Excellent, Reverend Kassapa, excellent! 
It is as if someone were to set up what had been knocked down, or to point out the way to one who had got lost, or to bring an oil-lamp into a dark place, so that those with eyes could see what was there. Just so has the Reverend Kassapa expounded the Dhamma in various ways. 
And I, Reverend Kassapa, go for refuge to the Blessed Lord, to the Dhamma, and to the Sangha. 
May the Reverend Kassapa accept me from this day forth as a lay-follower as long as life shall last! 
And, Reverend Kassapa, I want to make a great sacrifice. Instruct me, Reverend Kassapa, how this may be to my lasting benefit and happiness.’
^n438 ‘Prince, when a sacrifice is made at which oxen are slain, or goats, fowl or pigs, or various creatures are slaughtered,^f391 and the participants have wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness and wrong concentration, then that sacrifice is of no great fruit or profit, it is not very brilliant and has no great radiance. 
Suppose, Prince, a farmer went into the forest with plough and seed, 
and there, in an untilled place with poor soil from which the stumps had not been uprooted, were to sow seeds that were broken, rotting, ruined by wind and heat, stale, and not properly embedded in the soil, 
and the rain-god did not send proper showers at the right time — 
would those seeds germinate, develop and increase, and would the farmer get an abundant crop?’ 
‘No, Reverend Kassapa.’
‘Well then, Prince, it is the same with a sacrifice at which oxen are slain,... where the participants have wrong view, ... wrong concentration. 
But when none of these creatures are put to death, and the participants have right view, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, right concentration, then that sacrifice is of great fruit and profit, it is brilliant and of great radiance. 
Suppose, Prince, a farmer went into the forest with plough and seed, 
and there, in a well-tilled place with good soil from which the stumps had been uprooted, were to sow seeds that were not broken, rotting, ruined by wind and heat, or stale, and were firmly embedded in the soil, 
and the rain-god were to send proper showers at the right time — 
would those seeds germinate, develop and increase, and would the farmer get an abundant crop?’ 
′He would, Reverend Kassapa.’
‘In the same way, Prince, at a sacrifice at which no oxen are slain,... where the participants have right view,...right concentration, then that sacrifice is of great fruit and profit, it is brilliant and of great radiance.’
^n439 Then Prince Pāyāsi established a charity for ascetics and Brahmins, wayfarers, beggars and the needy. 
And there such food was given out as broken rice with sour gruel, and also rough clothing with ball-fringes.^f392
 And a young Brahmin called Uttara was put in charge of the distribution.^f393
 Referring to it, he said: 
‘Through this charity I have been associated with Prince Pāyāsi in this world, but not in the next.’
And Prince Pāyāsi heard of his words, 
so he sent for him and asked him if he had said that. 




‘Yes, Lord.’ 
‘But why did you say such a thing? 

Friend Uttara, don’t we who wish to gain merit expect a reward for our charity?’
‘But, Lord, the food you give — broken rice with sour gruel — you would not care to touch it with your foot, much less eat it! And the rough clothes with ball-fringes - you would not care to set foot on them, much less wear them! 
Lord, you are kind and gentle to us, so how can we reconcile such kindness and gentleness with unkindness and roughness?’ 
‘Well then, Uttara, you arrange to supply food as I eat 
and clothes such as I wear.’ 
‘Very good, Lord’, said Uttara, and he did so.^f394

^n440 And Prince Pāyāsi, because he had established his charity grudgingly, not with his own hands, and without proper concern, like something casually tossed aside, was reborn after his death, at the breaking-up of the body, in the company of the Four Great Kings, in the empty Serīsaka mansion. 
But Uttara, who had given the charity ungrudgingly, with his own hands and with proper concern, not as something tossed aside, was reborn after death, at the breaking-up of the body, in a good place, a heavenly realm, in the company of the Thirty-Three Gods.
^n441 Now at that time the Venerable Gavampati^f395 was accustomed to go to the empty Serisaka mansion for his midday rest. 
And Pāyāsi of the devas went to the Venerable Gavampati, saluted him, and stood to one side. And the venerable Gavampati said to him, as he stood there: 
‘Who are you, friend?’ 
‘Lord, I am Prince Pāyāsi.’ 
‘Friend, are you not the one who used to say: 
“There is no other world, there are no spontaneously born beings, there is no fruit or result of good or evil deeds”?’ 
‘Yes, Lord, I am the one who used to say that, 

but I was converted from that evil view by the Noble Kumāra-Kassapa.’ 
‘And where has the young Brahmin Uttara, who was in charge of the distribution of your charity, been reborn? ’ 
‘Lord, he who gave the charity ungrudgingly...was reborn in the company of the Thirty-Three Gods, 
but I, who gave grudgingly,... have been reborn here in the empty Serīsaka mansion. 
Lord, please, when you return to earth, 
tell people to give ungrudgingly ... 
and inform them of the way in which Prince Pāyāsi and the young Brahmin Uttara have been reborn.’

And so the Venerable Gavampati, on his return to earth, declared: 
‘You should give ungrudgingly, with your own hands, with proper concern, not carelessly. 
Prince Pāyāsi did not do this, and at death, at the breaking-up of the body, he was reborn in the company of the Four Great Kings in the empty Serīsaka mansion, 
whereas the administrator of his charity, the young Brahmin Uttara, who gave ungrudgingly, with his own hands, with proper concern and not carelessly, was reborn in the company of the Thirty-Three Gods.’
